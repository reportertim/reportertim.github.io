<p>Our goal at the JBJ is to tell our readers the news they need to know across the range of economic activity. To really do that would take a far larger staff, so we focus our attention on a few areas.</p>
<p>The goal is for you to own your beats — to be connected with the people and organizations making news, to think creatively about the stories that fall into these sectors and to both break news and explain the context that news is happening in.</p>
<p>There are some commonalities among them: All of the beats have real estate components, for example, and each has different public entities they’re expected to pay attention to.</p>
<p>There is some overlap: Some downtown projects fall on both real estate and retail, for example, and company expansions might cut across all the beats. There are also areas that float: An environmental story might land on the industrial beat or the real estate beat, say.</p>
<p>I’ve divided beats into primary and secondary categories. Your main focus is your primary beat, which should account for at least two thirds of the stories you cover and essentially all of the news you break. The secondary beats are areas to keep tabs on and cover assigned stories on; these are important, but don’t let them distract you from your main area of coverage.</p>
<p>I’m an unabashed fan of beats. I think they let you focus your attention and delve deeply into a topic. That said, don’t be afraid to push the boundaries of your beat; good stories are good stories, and I’m interested in them wherever you find them.</p>
<p>Here’s how things are divvied up:</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p><strong>Real Estate &amp; Growth</strong>
This beat focuses on the people and companies who are moving in to, out of and around the area, examining who is going where, how the deals are taking place, where growth is causing problems and how the region should manage things. On the very base level, this beat tracks who is making what real estate deals, particularly in the office space, and this reporter keeps an eye on all real estate activity in the area. Downtown and its growth is a key focus area, as is the successes and problems of residential development across the metro area.</p>
<p>Public entities covered include the DIA and DDRB, with some amount of attention paid to City Council.</p>
<p>Public companies include Regency Centers, Dream Finder Homes and Rayonier.</p>
<p>Records to look at daily include permits, deeds and site plans.</p>
<p>Key story lines are massive residential growth, issues of affordable housing, downtown revitalization efforts, hollowing out of the office space.</p>
<p>Secondary beats include health care and government.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial &amp; Development</strong>
This beat focuses on the companies and people who are making and moving things around the First Coast region. The focus is on the private and public companies active in the space, with a key focus on industrial real estate, maritime and trucking companies and railroads. Part of this beat is also looking at how transportation construction — highways, bridges, etc. — is responding to and shaping growth in the area.</p>
<p>Public entities include the various independent authorities (JEA, JTA, JAA, JPA) as well as the Mayor’s Budget Review Committee.</p>
<p>Public companies include CSX Corp, Landstar Systems, Duos Technologies and Redwire. Manufacturing is a growing part of this beat, particularly in Northwest Jacksonville. Since most of that activity is incentivized, this reporter also pays attention to overall economic development activity, with the MBRC and Jax Chamber under their purview.</p>
<p>Records to look at daily include permits, JEA service availability requests and water district applications</p>
<p>Key story lines include gyrations in the warehouse industry, the impact of the Emerald Trail, how highway construction (or its lack) is impacting growth, rebirth of the manufacturing sector, efforts to capitalize on deeper water.</p>
<p>Secondary beats includes banking and defense.</p>
<p><strong>Retail &amp; Small Business</strong>
This beat focuses on the interface between businesses and consumers, looking at how and where retailers and other small businesses are going, the challenges they’re facing and how they’re succeeding and failing. Restaurants and nightlife establishments are an important part of this beat, with the reporter chronicling changing trends and developments in the sector.</p>
<p>In cooperation with the managing editor, who oversees our Inno coverage, this reporter covers innovation writ large, particularly as it relates to fintech growth.</p>
<p>Records to look at daily include permits, zoning and land use changes.</p>
<p>Public companies include Fidelity National Information Service, Cadrenal Technologies and Treace Medical Concepts.</p>
<p>Key story lines include new restaurants/breweries/distilleries and the challenges they face, the growth of areas like the Town Center, River City Marketplace and Wildlight, funding challenges facing small businesses, growth in the fintech sector.</p>
<p>Secondary beat includes cultural business and sports business.</p>
