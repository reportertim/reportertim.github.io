</h1>
<p>The previous section laid out what we’re aiming to do. I now want to make that less abstract and talk specifically about the type of stories we’re looking for.</p>
<p>Continuing to work our way down the abstraction ladder, we’ll start out talking about what a JBJ story is and isn’t and then get into some expectations around number and types of posts you produce each week.</p>
<div id="what-were-looking-for" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>What we’re looking for<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-were-looking-for"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>As you’d expect, the stories we need stem directly from the goals listed previously.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, our goal is to tell people things they don’t know that will help them better understand and interact with the local economy.</p>
<p>Let me break that down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things they don’t know. This is the big one. If we’re writing stuff that’s already out there, there’s no point in us existing. We occupy a certain space in the media ecosystem, and to survive in that space, we have to own it — we have to be the go-to source for the news we cover. If we’re not breaking news, there’s no reason for people to read us.</li>
<li>Understand and interact. The stories we tell must be actionable. You have to have some sense of what someone could do with the information you’re presenting. Can they seize an opportunity? Can they avoid getting scammed? Can they make an investment? Will the course of their business or professional life be changed in some way? Every story you write, every story you pitch, you should be able to explain why it matters. What’s the bigger meaning, what’s the takeaway, what’s the lesson, what’s the action item.</li>
<li>The local economy. We’re the Jacksonville Business Journal. We cover Baker, Clay, Duval, Nassau and St. Johns Counties. The less a story is tied to those locales, the less we need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the goal that we’re aiming for. Let’s flip that around and talk about what we’re not doing.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are not here to promote businesses. While some of what we do will end up helping a business, that’s a side effect. We’re here to inform our readers, not to be a PR adjunct for a business: When we write that a business is hiring, it’s to help workers find jobs and business leaders know who is growing, not to help the company fill positions.</li>
<li>We’re not here as the paper of record. Our responsibility is to tell readers things they need to know, not all the things that happened. Just because an agency has a meeting or a company hires someone or an event happens does not mean that it’s worth writing about.</li>
<li>We’re not here to be a trade publication. As a broad statement: Your goal is to help people in one industry understand another industry; it’s to help restaurant owners wrap their minds around real estate, it’s to tell tech people what’s going on in transportation. If your story is only of interest to the industry you’re writing about, it’s probably perfectly fine for a trade publication — and I love trade publications — but it’s not for the JBJ.</li>
<li>We’re not here to write things simply because they’re interesting. Our stories should be interesting, but they need to go beyond that and be <em>meaningful</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On that last point, since it has sometimes been a sticking point, let me play out some examples.</p>
<p>Say JEA has a lineman who can scale a power pole faster than anyone in the Southeastern US. That’s vaguely interesting … but I have no idea what anyone could do with that information. That’s not a JBJ story.</p>
<p>Baptist has a new high tech machine that lets it do a different type of scan. That’s kinda cool … but are they hiring more people because of it? Do they expect an influx of patients because of it? Are they building a new facility because of it? Those questions are what lead to a JBJ story: If there’s no next step, if the story is just “huh, that’s a thing,” than we’re not fulfilling our goal of helping people interact with the economy.</p>
</div>
<div id="story-hierarchy" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Story hierarchy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#story-hierarchy"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The goal you should come in with every day is to let people know what is coming next. Where is a real estate deal going to happen, what trucking company is taking steps to expand, which startup is about to get funding, what brewery is about to open, who is about to be arrested, etc.</p>
<p>Close behind that is things that are happening: The warehouse developer pulled a permit, the restaurant signed a lease, the museum picked a contractor for its major expansion.</p>
<p>That’s the focus. That’s the stuff that you should be aiming for. But, importantly, let me be clear that I’m <em>not</em> expecting that on every story every day — not when you’re starting out, and not even after you’ve been here a while.</p>
<p>That type of journalism is the most important work we can do, but there’s also a beast that needs to be fed, a beat that needs to be maintained and a life that needs to be balanced with work.</p>
<p>The expectation is that you will file 7 to 10 posts a week. “Posts” is chosen specifically in that sentence: Not everything you file is created equally, and that’s OK.</p>
<p>Say you have two to three real, strong, breaking-news-to-readers stories a week. What’s the rest of your time spent doing?</p>
<p></p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/story_hierarchy.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>
People is a main thing: Q-and-As and profiles of significant people help you with the sourcing part of things. “Significant” is doing a lot of lifting in that sentence: If you’re going to spend the time spotlighting someone, it should be someone you expect to help you get stories in the first two tiers.</p>
<p>Strategy and context fall into the same sort of mindset. These are stories in which you step back from the significant thing and explain how a business is planning for the next significant thing or help our readers understand where a significant thing fits in. Again, though, that only fits in in service of reporting on significant things that will be or are being done.</p>
<p>You should have a Q-and-A every week (we’ll talk later about how to do them efficiently) as well as a strategy or context piece.</p>
<p>Finishing out the list of stuff is the still necessary but less important group of things that I’m calling “keeping track of stuff.” The bottom of the pyramid is the easiest bit to do — and, as a note of warning, something that is far too easy to do too much of.</p>
<p>In this category I’m thinking of AAA report on gas prices, monthly roundup of vacancy rates, credit union membership figures, an update on port traffic, unemployment figures … easy stories that may lead to other stories, but at the least keep you engaged with the industries you cover and keep the website beast fed.</p>
<p>You should have three to four of those sorts of stories a week.</p>
<p>Importantly, <em>you should not spend a lot of time on them</em>. These are not the stories we got into journalism to tell; we do them because they should help lead to the more important stories.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-thoughts" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Final thoughts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#final-thoughts"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to judge the worth of what we do — the reporting should be robust, the writing should be narratively engaging, etc. — but above all, the key thing I’m looking for in a JBJ story is meaningfulness.</p>
<div id="storiesbox" class="greybox" title="Onboarding Path">
<p>A lot of the things in this section will play out over your first 90 days. The goal is not to have you master all of this in your first week, but I want to set out from the beginning what we’re aiming to do.</p>
</div>
<p>There are two components that go into this.</p>
<p>First, it is vital to keep in mind who our audience is. We cover business. This covers a wide gamut — retail sales to fintech to culture to real estate, and everything in between — but this focus always has to be kept in mind. Most of the stories you do should have a dollar sign in them. Most of the people you quote should in some way be shaping the local economy.</p>
<p>Second, you should be looking for stories that can lead to action. A contractor decides not to work with a company because of improper behavior we’ve uncovered. A retailer decides to locate in a particular shopping center because of the big tenant we’ve told them is coming. Projects stop or start because of details we’re let our readers know about.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a quick q-and-a or an in-depth investigative piece, the goal is to write things that enable readers to change their trajectory: journalism that introduces a reader to a new business opportunity, or changes the way a reader thinks about a part of the city, or helps readers understand and make better decisions in their career, or in some other way provide new information about or a new understanding of the First Coast economy.</p>
<p>Every day, you should come in looking to:
* Break news. If you’re not finding stuff out first, our reporting is less valuable to our readers.
* Provide context. Our readers look to us for information they can act on. We need to tell them why events matter, what they mean and what’s coming next.
* Make introductions. Jacksonville is a big, spread-out city. You need to know the most important people on your beats and make sure the rest of the business community knows who they are.</p>
<p>The thought that should be forefront in your mind as you search for stories is why does this matter. There’s many ways to answer that question; here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we help our readers make money?</li>
<li>How can we help our readers spend money?</li>
<li>Who is being affected, positively or negatively, by the flows of money on the First Coast?</li>
<li>Who are the people winning and losing in the fight over money that our readers should know about?</li>
<li>Who is making money who shouldn’t be, or doing so in a way that they shouldn’t?</li>
<li>What novel things are being done with money, either strategically or operationally?</li>
<li>How can we help our readers avoid being scammed out of their money?</li>
<li>How can we make sure the money our readers have entrusted to the government is being spent wisely?</li>
</ul>
