</h1>
<p>So at this point you should have a good handle on what we’re trying to do here, understand how that goal plays out on a daily basis and grasp how important sourcing is to all of this.</p>
<p>Now you’re chafing at the bit: You’ve read a bunch of old stories, you’ve followed a bunch of people on social media, you’ve signed up for trade pub newsletters, you’ve had sources tell you stuff that matters.</p>
<p>Now you want to write.</p>
<p>One last hurdle: Every story at the JBJ, from a brief to a centerpiece, has to be pitched (or assigned … but the goal is mostly pitched.)</p>
<p>That raises the question that many new reporters have stumbled on: How do we want you to pitch a story?</p>
<p>The answer is that you need two to have two things: a concrete understanding of what the story is and an explanation as to why the story matters.</p>
<p>Both of those statements need to be unpacked</p>
<div id="know-what-the-story-is" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Know what the story is<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#know-what-the-story-is"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>For the first one: If you’re going to pitch a story, you need to know what it is. That may sound obvious, but if you’re scrambling for a story (and God knows I’ve been there), it’s easy to toss out a thing without really understanding it.</p>
<p>There are many, many things that are not stories that reporters may try to pitch as stories. A thing happening is not a story. An interesting person is not a story. A topic is not a story. A thing you heard about and would like to look into is not a story.</p>
<div id="pitchingbox" class="greybox" title="Onboarding Path">
<p>They key part of all of this is to take the early sections about what makes a story a JBJ story and keep it in the front of your mind as you look for things to write about: If you can’t explain why something matters, you probably don’t have a story. If you think there is a story there, see if an editor can help you find the meaning.</p>
</div>
<p>They might all lead to stories — and you might be able to fashion them into pitchable stories — but the bare fact of things existing is not enough.</p>
<p>A meeting is happening, someone was hired, someone wants to do something, the reporter says. Not enough. In that case, you need to go a bit deeper: what is actually happening; what is the thing that is or may be newsworthy.</p>
<p>This is a common sticking point for new reporters. “I’m going to go to a press conference.” “I’m going to cover a meeting.” “Company X has an announcement.” “A new report was released.”</p>
<p>Interesting, maybe? What’s happening at the press conference, what grabbed you on the meeting agenda, can you get the announcement under embargo, what’s newsworthy in the report?</p>
<p>In this same category of things that are not stories is topics. We’ll talk more about that in the next section — when we talk about turning topics into story ideas — but I’ll mention here that saying something along the lines of “The Eastside has a lot of interesting stuff going on” could be the start of a conversation, but isn’t itself a pitch.</p>
<p>Those are my questions at the first gate.</p>
<p>Many pitches fail at the second gate — explaining why the story matters.</p>
</div>
<div id="know-why-anyone-would-care" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Know why anyone would care<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#know-why-anyone-would-care"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Knowing why we’re digging out information to put in front of our readers is vital to the reporting and writing process because it will shape what information you have to gather and how you present it.</p>
<p>I’ll ask the “why the hell would anyone care” question in different ways — Why does this matter? What’s the impact? What can someone do with this information? How does this change things? What does this lead to? — but the all amount to explaining why this is something readers need to know.</p>
<p>Let me go through some examples to make this clear.</p>
<p><em>The DIA is having a meeting.</em> Not a story. The reporter hasn’t done the legwork to actually find out what the story is.</p>
<p><em>The DIA is going to consider changing its incentive policy at its next meeting.</em> This is a good first sentence. You’ve explained what the story actually is; I can picture a “DIA changes incentive policy” headline.</p>
<p><em>At its next meeting, the DIA is going to consider changing its incentive policy, which could change what type of businesses locate downtown.</em> That’s a full pitch. Now I understand what story you’re looking to get and who the readers of that piece could be.</p>
<p>Let me pause on that example for a moment because it illustrates an important point to all of this: If we’re busy, and you toss “The DIA might change its incentive policy at its next meeting; should I cover it?” at me, I might just say “yes” and move on <em>because in my head, I’m filling in the reason why it matters</em>. The problem with that is that you have no way of knowing that that is why I’m interested in the story … which makes things tougher in the writing and editing process.</p>
<p>Having the “why it mattes” bit explicitly laid out should help writing and editing go more smoothly.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<p><em>More cargo is coming to Jacksonville from South America than Asia.</em> I will be sure to note that for trivia night, but I’m not sure what else to do with that information. It works as a first sentence, but doesn’t answer the second.</p>
<p>What would a better pitch look like?</p>
<p><em>More cargo is coming to Jacksonville from South America than Asia, and now local companies are struggling to find Spanish-speaking cargo brokers.</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>More cargo is coming to Jacksonville from South America than Asia, and I’ve talked to two companies that have seen business surge because of it.</em></p>
<p>Now you’re telling readers who is winning and losing, which is always a good read; you’re giving readers an understanding of what they can do better; you’re opening up a new way of looking at the world for readers who hadn’t thought about these options before.</p>
<p>What’s the difference between the first example and the last examples? An explanation of why someone should care.</p>
<p>Why would someone read this and take an action, why would they decide they need to pay to read it, why would they read it and forward it to a coworker or put it on social media, how will it affect their lives, how does it have an impact beyond the time it takes the reader to close the tab?</p>
</div>
<div id="final-thoughts-3" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Final thoughts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#final-thoughts-3"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>As we’ll get to when we talk about enterprise reporting, having a well-thought-out pitch is vital for any sort of longer-form writing. If we’re asking readers to spend 20 minutes with a story, we need to damn well make sure it’s worth their while.</p>
<p>But thinking this way applies even to briefs. If we’re spending any time at all writing something, we need to have a good reason for expecting readers to care about it.</p>
<p>We’re not here to tell people vaguely interesting news or serve as the paper of record or to cover something because it gets you out of the office for the morning. We’re here to tell people news that they can do something with, news that matters.</p>
<p>Some of it will be big news, stories that we spend a lot of time on, stories that require expensive public records and deep sourcing and lots of writing time.</p>
<p>Some of it will be briefs that, yes, are just rewritten press releases — but they’re rewritten because there’s a reason people need to know that this promotion happened, that it matters that company X bought company Y.</p>
<p>Some final thoughts:</p>
<p>First, it’s important to keep in mind that everything you just read applies to <strong>actually pitching</strong> stories. As in, “I’m going to write a story on …” or “I’d like to cover …” .</p>
<p>None of this is to say that you can’t check in with an editor to see if something is worth covering. You’re new here; I don’t expect you to know what we consider important. Do not hesitate to ask if we care about a particular press release or if it’s worth finding out more about a development a source told you about or seeing if a broad topic would be news we would cover.</p>
<p>You <em>should</em> be having those conversations with the editors. You are new and don’t know what we care about.
Ask those questions, but ask them so you understand the lay of the land, rather than arguing for them as things you want to cover.</p>
<p>Those conversations will strengthen your ability to deal with the first sentence.</p>
<p>Second, and related, your ability to answer the second question should grow as you develop your source network. The only way to know why someone would care about the story you’re pitching is to be talking to the people who care.</p>
<p>Finally, feel free to pitch stories, even if you’re not sure we want them. I hired you because I think your viewpoint will add value to the team. If you think something is important, I want to hear about it — if we say no, we’ll explain why.</p>
