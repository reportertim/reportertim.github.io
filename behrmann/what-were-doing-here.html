<p>We’re going to spend a decent amount of time talking about <em>how</em> to do the journalism we do here at the JBJ. Before we start, though, I wanted to orientate the conversation by laying out what the goal is.</p>
<p>Our overarching aim is to be <em>the</em> source of news and information for and about the Northeast Florida business community. We’ll be the first to bring our readers the stories they need and want to read; we’ll be comprehensive and in-depth to a degree no one else is; we’ll dig out stories no one else knows about, connect our readers to people no one else is plugged into and provide information in more creative ways than anyone else.</p>
<p>More specifically, we aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be first. Our readers will get the news we provide before anyone else gives it to them.</li>
<li>Be comprehensive. We’ll go deeper and provide more context than anyone else.</li>
<li>Be better sourced. We talk to people no one else is talking to and have our sources tell us more than they tell anyone else.</li>
<li>Be accurate. In both small and big ways, we’ll be right, all of the time. Photo credits will be correct, typos will be caught, the thrust of stories will be spot on, our reporting will be bulletproof.</li>
<li>Move markets. Both in a literal sense — by providing news on public companies that investors can act upon — as well as more figuratively by providing information that changes how people see whatever it is we’re writing about, be it private companies, the city, an industry or a community.</li>
<li>Surprise people. In both our daily and weekly editions, readers will find things they don’t expect.</li>
<li>Be planned out. While we will be expert at reacting to events, our focus will be on driving the conversation. We’ll know what our readers need to do know and be working on providing it to them before they’re even aware that they need it.</li>
<li>Exploit a variety of media. Video, audio, slideshows, graphics, photography — we’ll tell stories using a multitude of forms, using various media to explore different aspects of the information we share.</li>
<li>Take risks — and sometimes fail. We’re looking to connect with new readers and help existing readers adapt to a changing world. That means we’ll do things that seem like good ideas but turn out not to be effective.</li>
<li>Be creative. Journalists can easily fall into a rut. Making sure we don’t do so is a key goal; we need to stretch ourselves, be open to new ideas and new ways of finding and presenting information.</li>
<li>Be focused. There are 8 million stories in the naked city; we can’t tell all of them. We’ll pick areas that we want to own and then go own the hell out of them.</li>
<li>Be broad. Not a contradiction to the previous goal but rather an admonition not to lose ourselves in being too narrow. Within the areas we own, we need to think broadly: What aspects are being overlooked? What players are being ignored? What information can we find that tells stories in our areas of focus that similarly focused journalists are missing?</li>
<li>Be skeptical. Sure, we’ll double-check if Mom says she loves us — but we’ll go beyond that. We’ll push back on the common wisdom, we’ll evaluate information with a jaundiced eye, we’ll make both naysayers and boosters prove what they’re saying.</li>
<li>Put the pieces together. I love breaking (as both an adjective and a verb) quick-hit news, and we’ll keep on doing that on a daily basis. We’ll also step back and break conceptual stories that give our readers even more value by showing what the news means as well as what it is.</li>
<li>Aim ever higher. Our goal is to make sure no one else in this town covers business like we do. We want to be first and best on the stories we care about. But our goal is not simply to do better than the work done by the rest of the media. Our goal is to have an impact, to drive the conversation, to be in a higher league than whatever else is being done.</li>
<li>Have fun. If we’re not enjoying what we do, we can’t expect our readers to connect with our work. Breaking important news, telling good stories, connecting with important people, making sense of the world we cover - all of these are fun things to do, and we should bring that sense of enjoyment to our work.</li>
