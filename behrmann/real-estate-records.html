<p>While a specific beat focuses on the real estate industry, real estate as a concept in (forgive the pun) foundational to everything we cover at the JBJ. Accordingly, each reporter is responsible for staying on top of specific real estate records.</p>
<p>I talked about the importance of records generally earlier. This section is devoted to specific public documents that need to be regularly reviewed.</p>
<p>One note: The city of Jacksonville recently changed some things on the records that can be accessed online, and in 2024, we’ll be rolling out a new tool that will assist with some of the record checking. In short, expect the <em>process</em> of dealing with the records to potentially change in some ways — but the mindset and habit of making record checking a daily part of your coverage will not.</p>
<p>To understand more about the development process it pertains to these records, these links might be helpful:</p>

<div id="daily-checks" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Daily checks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#daily-checks"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I mentioned “staying on top of records” above — and doing so is a key part of everyone’s job. Each reporter is tasked with checking a particular set of records on a daily basis, looking for stories both on their beats and for ones that other reporters might be interested in.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p><strong>Permits</strong></p>
<p>I’m starting out with permits because they generate the most news, and they’re records that we all engage with.</p>
<p>Permits are applied actually fairly far along in the development process; for any large-scale projects, we should first notice that something is happening when the land is rezoned or a site plan is submitted.</p>
<p>In all cases, though, the application for a permit and the issuance of it is a sign that work is actually beginning. There’s a plethora of stories that can come out of that fact, which is why all reporters should be looking at what’s going on with permits.</p>
<p>As laid out below, each reporter will be looking for different things in the permit system. The starting point is the same:</p>
<p>Log into the system at <a href="https://jaxepics.coj.net/">https://jaxepics.coj.net/</a> using <a href="mailto:tgibbons@bizjournals.com" class="email">tgibbons@bizjournals.com</a>, with OUTPUT7rag.profile as the password. (This log-in info is likely to change.)</p>
<p>Go to the advanced search screen. Change the intake date to whenever you last searched. If you haven’t searched in a while or you want to make sure you haven’t missed anything, you can also skip the date field and search by status, looking for Active (In Review), Agency Review, In Review and Intake. (Note: I’m not 100% sure on the interplay between actual intake date and when something hits the system, so this part of the process may have to be tweaked slightly.)</p>
<p>Here’s how individual searches should take place:</p>
<p><em>Real Estate Reporter</em></p>
<p>To find large residential projects, search Structure Type: Apartments, Condominiums, Single Family Subdivision, Townhouse and Job Cost: 5000000 to 1000000000</p>
<p>To find office projects, change Structure Type to Business Condo; Business, Office, Bank, Professional; and High Rise and drop the Job Cost to 1000000 to 1000000000.</p>
<p>To find hotels, change Structure Type to Hotel, Motel, Dormitory; and Transient, Hotel, Motel, Rooming House with a Job Cost of 1000000 to 1000000000.</p>
<p>The real estate reporter also compiles the weekly Crane Watch round up of the top six projects that received permits over the preceding seven days.</p>
<p>To get that information:</p>
<p>At <a href="https://jaxepics.coj.net/">jaxepics.coj.net</a>, click on the reports tab in the upper toolbar, and then select daily reports. Download the past seven days (Monday through Sunday, typically).</p>
<p>Delete the city logo and the first three rows. Select everything and unmerge cells. Select everything again and copy it into a new spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Once you have the entire period on one spreadsheet, sort by construction cost. Note the Permit Number of the top six items and go back to the city website to get the details. Pay attention to projects that have received multiple permits; I usually scan the top 20 or so to check for that.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p><em>Industrial Reporter</em></p>
<p>To find industrial projects, search Structure Type: Fuel-Bulk Facility, Fuel-Service Terminal; Industrial, Factory; Marine Wharf; Other, Storage Warehouse; and Warehouse with a Job Cost of 1000000 to 1000000000.</p>
<p><em>Retail Reporter</em></p>
<p>To find retail projects, search for Structure Type: Restaurants and Stores, Mercantile, with a job cost of 50000 to 1000000000.</p>
<p>In all cases, once you find permits that might be interesting, click on the little arrow box next to the permit number and go to the Specs tab, which should give you a sense of what the project is. You should also click on the Links tab and see if there are other permits associated with the filing. The Contacts tab will give you a starting point for talking to a person.</p>
<p>While all reporters keep on eye on permits, the rest are divided up, with the reporter who is most likely to find something useful keeping on top of them. As you look at these records, keep an eye out for things that would fall on other beats as well as things that you’ll write about.</p>
<p><strong>Site plans</strong></p>
<p>Site plans review one of the earliest steps taken in the development process, with the city examining these plans for a variety of factors. For our purposes, these documents tell you a lot about what a project entails, including possible tenants, who is doing the work and more.</p>
<p><em>The real estate reporter is responsible for reviewing these filings on a daily basis.</em></p>
<p>To see what site plans have been filed, go to <a href="https://jaxcivilplan.coj.net/">jaxcivilplan.coj.net</a>.</p>
<p><em>Without logging in</em>, change the Plan Type to “Civil Plan” and Search Type to “Status.” You Want to look for filings that are in Intake and In Agency Review.</p>
<p>Sort by Status Change Date and then click on the blue document icon on the right for anything that has changed since you last searched. Go to General Project Information and look at the Project Summary. If it looks like it might be something we’re interested in, go to the attachments tab. Toward the bottom should be a link for current site plans; download those. (If you don’t get them when they’re first filed, they’re hard to get in the future.)</p>
<p>Once you’ve gathered the documents you think we might be interested in, talk to an editor about what’s worth a story.</p>
<p>You can also look at all the plans being reviewed by logging into the site (<a href="mailto:tgibbons@bizjournals.com" class="email">tgibbons@bizjournals.com</a> / <a href="mailto:xQ7IE3*2@1fU" class="email">xQ7IE3*2@1fU</a>).</p>
<p>Once you’ve logged in, click on Civil Plan and then click on Plan Review Dashboard (up top), opening it in a new tab. Click on the Export to Excel button and then open it and sort by Clock Start Date, newest to oldest. You can then get the CDN number for any interesting looking projects and go back to the website and review the plans</p>
<p><strong>Deeds</strong></p>
<p>Deeds show who is buying and selling property in the area, giving us a sense of who is coming to town, who is cashing out and where interest is the strongest.</p>
<p><em>The real estate reporter is responsible for reviewing these filings on a daily basis.</em></p>
<p>Here’s how to access the records:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://oncore.duvalclerk.com/search/Disclaimer?st=/search/SearchTypeConsideration">the Duval County Court</a> and search by Consideration</li>
<li>Put 1000000 as lower bound and a zillion as upper bound (the upper bound doesn’t matter; just put in 1 followed by a lot of zeros)</li>
<li>Change the date range to the past week (this will make sure you don’t miss anything that got filed weirdly)</li>
<li>Sort by consideration</li>
<li>We care about deeds, mostly; mortgages are useful as supplemental information</li>
<li>Anything over $10 million could be newsworthy</li>
<li>Click on the listing to bring up the documents</li>
<li>If you’re lucky, there will be a parcel number; you can get info on the property appraiser site at <a href="https://paopropertysearch.coj.net/Basic/Search.aspx" class="uri">https://paopropertysearch.coj.net/Basic/Search.aspx</a>, searching for that number in the RE# field. (You can locate the property at <a href="https://maps.coj.net/duvalproperty/default.aspx" class="uri">https://maps.coj.net/duvalproperty/default.aspx</a>)</li>
<li>If there is no parcel number, try searching the appraiser’s site for the seller’s name; the property appraiser lags the court system.</li>
<li>Take what you’ve found and talk to an editor; over time, you’ll get a sense of what we care about.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>St. Johns Water Management District</strong></p>
<p>Water management requests are the first step for large scale developments that anticipate using a lot of water or having a major environmental impact - particularly large manufacturing operations.</p>
<p><em>The industrial reporter is responsible for reviewing these filings on a daily basis.</em></p>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://permitting.sjrwmd.com/ep/#/ep">Water Management District Permitting site</a>, click on the Search tab up top and then on Regulatory Search.</p>
<p>On the form that pops ups, select Baker, Clay, Duval, Nassau, Putnam and St. Johns counties, change Date Type to “Received Date” and put in the last time you looked in “From Date.”</p>
<p>In general, we care about consumptive use permits and the various ERP categories. If you find one that looks interesting, click on the permit number and then download the Application pdf. Page 3, under proposed activities, will tell you want the project is.</p>
<p>If anything looks like it might be interesting, check with an editor.</p>
<p><strong>JEA</strong></p>
<p>Water availability requests are similar to the SJWMD filings: They’re a sign that someone is about to do something that uses a lot of water.</p>
<p><em>The industrial reporter is responsible for reviewing these filings on a daily basis.</em></p>
<p>To see these filings, go to JEA’s (outsourced) <a href="https://www.sagesgov.com/Home/Search.aspx">filing page</a> and log in: <a href="mailto:tgibbons@bizjournals.com" class="email">tgibbons@bizjournals.com</a> / incur7grits4integral*penance, selecting JEA as your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Click on the search tab and set the submission date as “this week.” Set process to Developer Agreement, Development Meeting Request, Pre-Acceptance Letter Request and Service Availability Request. (The last one is the main one generating news.)</p>
<p>See what looks interesting — we don’t care about single family homes or septic systems — and then talk to an editor.</p>
<p><strong>Zoning Applications</strong></p>
<p>The most interesting zoning applications usually involve bars, restaurants and other retail operations who need some sort of variance or other official sign off to open their operation.</p>
<p><em>The retail reporter is responsible for reviewing these filings on a daily basis.</em></p>
<p>The easiest way to get this data is to go to <a href="https://maps.coj.net/luzap/SearchZoningPublic.aspx">the city’s zoning map</a>. Click search and then look at those with a “filed complete” and a “pending” status (two separate searches). Sort by Submitted.</p>
<p>For anything new since the last time you checked, open the application and click through the various steps, which should be enough to give you a sense of what the project is. (We particularly care about anything that is looking to change to a planned-unit development or PUD.)</p>
<p>If anything grabs your attention, check with an editor to see if it’s worth a story.</p>

</h2>
<p>This process seems complicated … and it will be, at first. After a few weeks of engaging with these records, it will become second nature.</p>
<p>Two key things to keep in mind: You need to look at these things every day; the process becomes more complicated (or impossible) if you fall behind. Also, notice how often “check with an editor” shows up in the information above. You’re <em>not</em> expected to know precisely what we care about during your early days here. Talking through what you find in the documents will help focus your news judgement and make the entire process less scary.</p>
