<p>A previous section talked about planning in the overall production sense. I now want to spend a bit of time talking about things that might help you in organizing your work at the JBJ in a way that will help sidestep some common areas of stress.</p>
<div id="tools" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Tools<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tools"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We talked about using Airtable for production budgeting — but it can also be useful as a personal budgeting tool. If you give a story the “Planning” status, it does not show up in the public-facing displays, which means you can plan out stories weeks in advance for your own time-management purposes.</p>
<p>I find it helpful to put in all the stories that I know I want to get to in the coming month or so and move them around in the personal calendar view. This lets you graphically see where your busy times are and when you can carve out time for, i.e., centerpiece interviews and the like.</p>
<p>Speaking of calendars: I would urge you to calendar things obsessively. Obviously you’ll put meetings and appointments on your calendar, but it is very helpful to put anything that should be done at a certain time. For example, if you know a particular agency releases its meeting agenda on a certain day, put that on your calendar: If you have a 15-minute “11:00 a.m. third Friday: Request JZA agenda package”, you’re not only reminding yourself to do it, but you’re giving yourself time to do it.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can use your calendar to progress your reporting. A source says check back at the end of the month about a thing? Pull out your phone and schedule “check back with source about a thing” on a particular day at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Calendaring the things before the thing — calling analysts before an earnings release, reaching out to a source the week before a decision is made, checking in with a source every month on a project you can’t nail down yet — keeps you ahead of the game.</p>
<p>There’s few things more aggravating than owning a story and then having it slip away because someone else remembered to check back on what happened on the thing that you broke the news about. Setting reminders ahead of time will help avoid that pain.</p>
<p>On the subject of outsourcing your brain: Sign up for news alerts and create Google alerts.</p>
<p>From the moment you start working here, you’re generating a mental list of the people, companies, topics and more that are important to your work … and that list will just keep getting longer.</p>
<p>While you’ll be breaking news on all of those things, other people will be writing about them, too, <em>and you need to know when they do.</em> The answer: Google alerts. Tell Google to look for the companies, etc., that you cover and send you that on an as-it-happens basis. This won’t stop you from getting beat, but it will let you know when it happens and better position you to respond, and it will also make sure that you’re staying in the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>One tip: Set up a dedicated Gmail account for the alerts. That will give you an easily searchable repository and prevent overloading your real inbox if you accidentally make a search too broad.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that journalism can be Sisyphean. The only way to avoid that is to put the stone down at some point and spend some time thinking through your beats.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that you schedule regular times devoted to sourcing planning, idea generation and documents and data. (We’ll talk more about documents and data in a bit.) By this I mean something like taking an hour every Thursday to come up with a list of what sources you want to connect with in the coming week, spending an hour every other Friday to refresh your idea list and setting aside an hour Tuesday evening to look at your coverage and see what data might exist or records could be requested.</p>
<p><em>This is a hard habit to get into</em>, but if you can make those three things a regular part of your reporting practice, you’re prepping the field for a harvest that will pay off in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="talking" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Talking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#talking"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We don’t do a lot of meetings at the JBJ, but the one that I think is the most important is the one-on-ones I have with each of the journalists here. That said, it is very easy to have these slip away, with the exigencies of journalism taking precedent.</p>
<p>These meetings should be a priority for you, and you should come prepared to discuss how things are going, what you’re working on, areas where you could use help, etc. A key goal of these meetings is to help you prioritize, but that requires knowing what’s on your plate.</p>
<p>In addition, turn to the other editors and your fellow reporters. Everyone who works here comes with their own set of skills, background and experience, and tapping into those can help you see things in different ways and advance your reporting in new directions.</p>
