</h1>
<p>By and large, the way that we find stories are though people (hence the section on sourcing) and through records.</p>
<p>Sourcing is the most important part of that duo: If we’re doing our jobs properly, people can tell us about stories before they’re evident in the records, and knowledgeable people can direct us to look at records we might not otherwise review.</p>
<p>Our records reporting falls into a couple of different overlapping areas. As exhaustively detailed later in this document, each reporter has records related to real estate that they should look at every day. It is not uncommon for those records to be the tripwire that first alerts us to news happening.</p>
<p>Our reporting goes beyond that, though, with requested records and a variety of data sources playing into what we provide our readers.</p>
<p>In this section, I’m going to run through a brief introduction on the records we use the most, mainly to make sure you know what is out there. We’ll then look at the broader categories of records that may be of interest and then wrap up by talking about how to make records-based reporting part of your overall repertoire.</p>
<div id="recordsbox" class="greybox" title="Onboarding Path">
<p>Records reporting (and the adjacent skill of data reporting) will take some time to learn if it’s not part of what you’ve done regularly. As you start out here, you should focus on two things: spending time with records on a daily basis and cultivating an overall mindset to be looking for records and data that will bolster your reporting.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-basics" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>The basics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-basics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There are some public record sources that we turn to on a regular basis to find details that can flesh out a wide variety of stories. You should familiarize yourself with these sites and use them often:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/ByName">Sunbiz</a>: The Florida Division of Corporations keeps track of every company that does work in the state (more or less). Through this site, you can find out details about the companies you’re writing about: Who are their officers? When were they started? What other companies are they tied to?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an important backgrounding site, but some caveats do apply. One very important one: <em>The registered agent name doesn’t necessarily mean anything.</em> Just because two companies have the same registered agent <em>does not</em> mean that they are connected. For many limited liability companies, the corporate registry will be a bit of a dead end, so don’t overly get your hopes up. One tip: google the <em>address</em> of the authorized person(s); this can often point you in a useful direction.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Property appraiser for <a href="https://paopropertysearch.coj.net/Basic/Search.aspx">Duval County</a> and <a href="https://qpublic.schneidercorp.com/Application.aspx?App=StJohnsCountyFL&amp;Layer=Parcels&amp;PageType=Search">St. Johns County</a>. This will give you information about who owns a property you care about, who owns nearby properties, when buildings were built, when sales took place, etc. If you have an address, the property appraiser is a good first step; it will give you the name of the property owner, which you can then plug into Sunbiz.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jacksonville <a href="https://jaxepics.coj.net/">Building Inspection Division</a>. We’ll talk a lot about permits in the next section, with an eye toward using those records to break news. You should also turn to this site throughout the reporting process. Writing about a restaurant opening? A new warehouse? This is where you can find out how much construction cost, who built the structure and similar things.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="other-records" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Other records<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-records"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I mentioned Sunbiz earlier; while that is the most commonly use source of state records, there’s a few others that often come in handy.</p>
<p>One of the most useful sites is the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which has a nifty <a href="http://www.myfloridalicense.com/dbpr/instant-public-records/">instant public records</a> subsite.</p>
<p>This site is probably most used on the retail beat — the <a href="http://www.myfloridalicense.com/DBPR/alcoholic-beverages-and-tobacco/public-records/">alcohol records</a> enable us to do things like examine <a href="https://reportertim.github.io/breweries_data.html">the local brewery scene</a> and do the weekly Roach Report. (The Roach Report data can be <a href="http://www.myfloridalicense.com/DBPR/hotels-restaurants/public-records/#1506344763000-101d4ee5-7a59">found here</a>; <em>this is something the real estate reporter should do weekly.</em>)</p>
<p>That said, the state also licenses harbor pilots and architects, hotels and yachts … there’s stories in that data on the most dangerous elevators and most successful engineers and more, if you want to dig them out.</p>
<p>Florida has a plethora of things that are public records, on both a state and a local level. While this list lays out how to access the items that have proven useful in the past, I don’t assume this is complete. If you come across something that might be useful on your beat or for others, or if you find a trove of data and just think there might be potential there, please let me know.</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of federal records.</p>
<p>The industrial reporter should spend some time looking at the <a href="https://transtats.bts.gov/">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>, for instance, which has a plethora of transportation data, as well as things like the <a href="https://transtats.bts.gov/">Surface Transportation Board data page</a>.</p>
<p>The real estate reporter could find stories in the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/historic-data/">CFPB’s HDMA data</a>, and the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">St. Louis Fed’s economic data</a> site could provide information makes a retail story more robust.</p>
<p>Cutting across beats, <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/">USAspending.gov</a> goes in depth on who is getting federal money, which could feed into a variety of stories.</p>
<p>And, finally, we have access to <a href="https://pcl.uscourts.gov/pcl/index.jsf">Pacer, the entry point to federal courts</a>. While no one is tasked with looking at that regularly, it can be a good source of stories, usually after we’ve been tipped off to look at something in particular.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In writing this section, I’ve somewhat conflated records and data, and I want to tease those two things apart a bit. While we don’t have a dedicated data reporter on staff, we have people with varying levels of skill in Excel, R and Python — which means that if you don’t have those skills, you have somewhere to turn.</p>
<p>Many, many stories should have some sort of data component. That might be as complex as “how many of this thing happened in different ZIP codes over a decade” or as simple as “what is the average rent in this neighborhood today.” Any story that is focused on something changing over time or varying between areas is best told with some amount of data underpinning the narrative.</p>
<p>As you think through who you should talk to for a story, also think about what numbers might be available to support or flesh out what you’re hearing from sources. (Or to contradict what you’re hearing from sources; it is not uncommon for “the narrative” to be one thing but for the truth to be something else once you get the numbers.)</p>
<p>On a basic level, when a source tells you a number, ask where it came from. Oftentimes a simple story can lead to something with more depth if we go back to the original source of the data and look at the information in context.</p>
</div>
<div id="records-requests" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Records requests<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#records-requests"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Everything laid out above dealt with records that you can look up independently. That should not be the end of your records-based reporting.</p>
<p>You should cultivate a mindset of regularly requesting public records from any public entity you deal with — the city, the state, independent authorities, etc.</p>
<p>On a basic level, pretty much every meeting should lead to records request (most likely both before and after the meeting). As laid out in the section on covering meetings, you should be requesting agendas and supporting documentation as soon as they’re available. If something newsworthy happens in the meeting, you should request whatever background information there might be.</p>
<p>Every bigger story you do should have you stop and consider what public documents might be available: Could someone have emailed the mayor about this? Did something need to be filed with the state? High up on the frustration chart is when you’ve broken a story based on sourcing, but someone else advances the news by getting records that you didn’t think to ask for.</p>
<p>You should also have regularly reoccurring records request. We know, for instance, that the master developer of Cecil Commerce Center sends a report to the city four times a year; the industrial reporter should have a calendar reminder to ask for that. We have ongoing coverage on downtown projects; the real estate reporter should be asking for any new records related to those on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Making such requests a regular part of your reporting practice will set up a pipeline of documents coming in that will lead to future stories.</p>
<p>(To help keep everything straight, I like using a spreadsheet <a href="https://acbj-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/tgibbons_bizjournals_com/Ea65ng1GEW9OqWxEPRx1TzkBMyipS5wkbaYueyRBy6mmkw?e=NFxJmG">like this</a>, which you can feel free to copy. Oh, and if you’re new to Florida, here’s a <a href="https://acbj-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/tgibbons_bizjournals_com/EfD3WnLQ15tHl5L4WWqUNpcBazng7XTyUZ-0wdpofYVfyQ?e=xzp1Bf">template for public records requests</a>.)</p>
</div>
<div id="a-warning" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>A warning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-warning"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Dealing with records and data is an important part of good reporting — but it can also be a tar pit. I point that out not to contradict anything you’ve just read but as a warning: If you find yourself spending a substantial amount of time wrangling records or data and it’s not going anywhere, stop and talk to an editor.</p>
<p>We’ve had times where a reporter wasn’t looking in the right spot for records, resulting in a far more laborious process than was needed. We’ve had times where someone with more Excel skill could show a struggling reporter how to do something more quickly. We’ve had times when everything was progressing as quickly as it could, but it was still taking too long, and the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze. We’ve had times where an initial story could be written and then followed up on when a records request was fulfilled, but the reporter got beat while waiting.</p>
<p>While I urge you to think of how records and data can enhance your reporting, beware of getting stuck in a rabbit hole.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-thoughts-1" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Final thoughts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#final-thoughts-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>So this section purposefully went somewhat into the weeds, giving what I hope is a good overview of both what is expected on your end and what information is available to you.</p>
<p>As we wrap up, I want to take a step back and talk briefly about the mindset and the approach you should have when it comes to records, records requests, data and public information in general.</p>
<p>I’ll reiterate that sourcing is the most important part of the reporting process — but dealing with records is a close second, helping you to keep sources honest, find stories sources don’t want to talk about and have a deeper knowledge of the things you’re writing about.</p>
<p>The goal is to have you always be thinking about what records and data can make your reporting better and then to get you in the habit of looking for and requesting that information. If you adopt that mindset, you’ll have more and better things to write about and will make sure your not blindsided when news breaks.</p>
