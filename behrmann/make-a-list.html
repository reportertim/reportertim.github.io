</h1>
<p>What stories are you hearing about that you want to break?</p>
<p>Again, sourcing is paramount here … but after a few months on the job, you should have a list of stories that you can’t quite nail down yet.</p>
<p>You’ve heard a building is being sold or a retailer is coming to town or a project is running into trouble – but the reporting isn’t yet solid enough to write that story.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of those things</em> — and make sure you’re staying on top of them.</p>
<p>Every time you talk to someone who might be able to incrementally advance the reporting, or who might know who else to talk to, toss a question or two at them. Put a weekly call to the PR person on your calendar; “hey, any movement?”</p>
<p>Be purposeful about the pursuit; there’s nothing more frustrating than being aware of news that someone else breaks because you backburnered it.</p>
<div id="drive-the-conversation" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Drive the conversation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#drive-the-conversation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>When I say “set the base for something higher,” embedded in that concept is the idea that you should know what “higher” is.</p>
<p>One way of thinking about it is that you want your stories to drive the important conversations happening on your beat. What are the things that our readers most care about? What information are they most in need of?</p>
<p>Figuring this out will be part of the ongoing conversations you have with the editors, and it’s not something that I expect you to do right off the bat. But I do expect you to be thinking this way from the get-go.</p>
<p>As you read back through our coverage, as you talk to sources and you begin reporting, always have the idea in the back of your mind that you’re trying to identify the broad stories where you can have the most impact.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-a-body-of-work" class="section level2" number="16.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">16.1</span> Create a body of work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-a-body-of-work"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I referenced this in the section on idea generation, and it’s key approach to both coming up with stories and having those stories be high impact.</p>
<p>Once you’ve been here a few months, we’ll have a conversation about the areas of your beat that are the most important and the most interesting to you. The goal is to pick a somewhat broad topic and mine it for all that it’s worth.</p>
<p>The way to think through this: If your work on this topic was compiled at the end of the year, you’d have a book. What would be in that book? And, can you purposefully set out to make that book as good as possible?</p>
<p>It’s easy to let the pressure of news direct your coverage — and most of the time, it should. But by picking a topic that you will own, that you will fully explore, you’ll be able to build something substantial.</p>
<p>This can be challenging: If you’re saying that there is a topic on your beat that you want to cover fully, that means doing a few stories every month on that topic. Sometimes you’ll have to dig deep to find a new angle or come up with a new person to talk to … but the payoff is that you’re required to go beyond the surface and think creatively about how to advance the story.</p>
<p>Again, this doesn’t come into play your first few months here; you need to know what is important and what you’re most interested in. For now, though, have this concept in mind as something that you’re thinking about for when we have that conversation.</p>
