<p>The most common type of longer-form reporting you’ll do at the JBJ are the centerpieces that run in print and online each week. On average, you’ll do about one of these a month.</p>
<p>These stories give you the opportunity dig in deep into a topic, provide more context than you might do in a daily story and perhaps have more fun with the writing.</p>
<p>Journalistically, these stories should have the most impact. Egotistically, these stories should demonstrate the best work we can do. Mercenarily, these are the clips that will propel you to your next job. Personally, these stores are the most fun to write and edit.</p>
<p>For some reporters, these stories can be daunting, so we’ve established a system that will help you progress through the reporting and writing process.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, though, I want to lay out in general terms what we’re looking for in a CP and talk about ways to develop good ideas for these stories.</p>
<div id="centerpiecebox" class="greybox" title="Onboarding Path">
<p>You’ll have several weeks before you have to begin working on your first centerpiece (unless some massive news breaks on your beat in your early days). Take that time to think about the topics you’re hearing the most about, the things sources seem most excited about and the things that grab your attention the most.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-makes-a-cover-story" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>What makes a cover story<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-makes-a-cover-story"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>At its heart, a cover story is a 1,200- to 1,800-word piece of journalism. The important thing is that they’re not long for the sake of being long; they’re longer because you have a story that needs to be told at that length.</p>
<p>These stories bring in a wider array of sources and look to examine different aspects of the topic being written about. They are also heavily designed items, featuring photography and graphics; it’s important that you’re thinking of things that will help tell the story visually.</p>
<p>Every good cover story will have or accomplish one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive the conversation. This is hard to do in your first story, but it is something to keep in mind: Whenever possible, you want to do a story that pushes the discussion around the industries you cover to a new level. What does Jacksonville have to do to become the next drone center of excellence/rebuild downtown/elevate its food scene/grow its economy/etc.? What’s missing in the planning for X? What should our readers be thinking about as they plan for the future?</li>
<li>Have tension or conflict. If you’re just telling our readers that something is happening, you probably don’t need 1,000+ words to do it. To engage the reader, you have to delve into what is or tried to stop the thing from happening. You should look for challenges that have to be overcome (or were), people who are at odds, visions that differ … Sometimes this will be actual conflict; sometimes it will be overcoming challenges; either way, the story should have tension.</li>
<li>Introduce our readers to people who matter. One of our roles is to help our readers know the key players in industries other than their own. Cover stories are a chance to dig in with important people — particularly if they’re not well known yet — and to connect to a broader array of people than we do in daily coverage.</li>
<li>Provide context. Whether its data or public records or just multiple interviews, cover stories are a way to ground daily reporting in the broader picture. When they’re done reading your story, people who may have known what happened should also know the why and the how.</li>
<li>Have a narrative arc. These stories give you the time and space to move behind straight news reporting and have fun with the writing. While they’re not feature stories — i.e., you have to have news in them — they do provide an opportunity for more creative writing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="types-of-centerpieces" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Types of centerpieces<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-centerpieces"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I think of cover stories as coming in three varieties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex CPs</li>
<li>Standard CPs</li>
<li>Off-the-news CPs</li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction doesn’t really matter — these are spots on a continuum, not different buckets — but it can be useful in coming up with ideas.</p>
<p>Complex CPs are the ones where you really dig in deep. You might be working on them for several months, they might involve larger public records requests, they might have a significant number of sources, etc.</p>
<p>Standard CPs are the same, but at a lower scale: If you have six sources for a complex CP, maybe you have four for a simple one; a complex CP might merge data together from different databases, while a simple one relies on crunching just one set of numbers.</p>
<p>Off-the-news CPs can be any level of complexity; the difference is in turn-around time, with these being completed over days rather than weeks.</p>
<p>You’ll be doing 12 to 14 cover stories a year, and splitting them up among the three groups is a good idea. Maybe eight of the CPs you do will be the standard type: a slightly evergreen story that is planned out and is reported on written over the course of a month or so.</p>
<p>You should also always be looking for the daily stories that with a day or two of more reporting, could be made a centerpiece, with the goal of doing three or four of those a year.</p>
<p>You should also take advantage of the opportunity to have a few more ambitious pieces in there. We’ll talk more about the complex CPs after you’ve been here for a few months and have your base more established, but my goal for you is to have one or two of these stories each year.</p>
</div>
<div id="coming-up-with-ideas" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Coming up with ideas<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#coming-up-with-ideas"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>A very important point: <em>Centerpieces come out of your beat reporting.</em></p>
<p>I’m not opposed, in theory, to the idea of using the expanded real estate provided by centerpieces to chase down a story that isn’t on anyone’s beat … but that approach is far secondary to using this reporting time and effort to delve into the things that you cover.</p>
<p>There’s two basic approaches to coming up with ideas. First, look at your reporting and find things you’ve written about that can be expanded upon or that haven’t spent as much time with as they deserve. Second, you can decide you want to do a particular type of story and see what on your beat would fit in that bucket.</p>
<p>For the first approach, here’s some steps to go through — questions you should ask yourself — to generate solid ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there themes in your reporting that you can pull together? Look back over your recent work; is there a story that you’ve told bits and pieces of that you can put in context or build upon for a larger point?</li>
<li>Is there an aspect of your daily stories that would benefit from a deeper dive? If you’ve done daily stories that have covered an event or decision or a thing happening, is it worth getting deeper into the weeds on it?</li>
<li>Is there an area of your beat that isn’t worth doing daily stories on but is worth one strong look at? What parts of your beat are important but don’t toss up a lot of ongoing news?</li>
<li>Is there a topic people are talking about that is interesting but that doesn’t have a lot of movement? It can be easy to overlook slow-moving stories that don’t generate daily articles but have gradually shifted the paradigm; pulling a bunch of threads together can be a great service to our readers.</li>
<li>Is there something on the horizon that you haven’t written about because it’s not news yet but that you can get in front of through a comprehensive sort of story?</li>
<li>Are people wrong about something? If you have sources saying the common wisdom isn’t correct, it might be worth a centerpiece exploring the subject in question. These articles take strong reporting and nuanced writing but can be some of the strongest work we produce.</li>
<li>Is someone doing something weird/interesting/intriguing? Thin of the classic WSJ A-heds. These stories often require more work on the front end to nail down why readers would care, but the effort can be rewarding.</li>
<li>Are there disparate pieces of information you can pull together that our often-siloed sources wouldn’t connect — how warehouse development is affecting residential growth, how symphony changes is spurring restaurant activity, how interest rate changes are making life difficult for shippers …</li>
<li>Are your sources chattering about something that doesn’t lend itself to daily coverage but could benefit from a more feature-y or data-driven treatment?</li>
<li>Is there someone on your beat worth a profile?</li>
<li>Have you come across data — or heard about data you could get — that our readers should know about?</li>
</ul>
<p>Those last two questions start moving away from the first way of coming up with cover stories — building on your reporting — to the second way — starting with a story form and finding something that fits it.</p>
<p>To approach cover stories that way, I’d suggest thinking things through in these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to do a profile: Are there people who come up a lot in our coverage that our readers don’t know, or are there people who are behind the scenes who should be brought on stage?</li>
<li>If you want to do a data dive: Is there an aspect of your beat that someone has data on that we can get?</li>
<li>If you want to do a more narrative story: Is there a story — a true business story — that can be told with characters and scenes, and do you have the access to be able to tell that story?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="things-to-do" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Things to do<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#things-to-do"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>No matter how much time you have to report and write a CP or what type of approach you’re taking, <em>every</em> centerpiece needs to include two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does this story matter? One graf, high up in the story, explaining why this is a piece of writing that is worth the reader investing his or her time into.
<ul>
<li>What’s the impact of what you’re writing about on the person, the company, the industry, Jacksonville?</li>
<li>How will the information you’re telling the reader shape their approach to the local economy?</li>
<li>What can the reader do or not do after reading the story?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What comes next? Every important story sets the stage for things happening in the future. What should the reader be expecting to be coming in the future?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="things-not-to-do" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Things not to do<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#things-not-to-do"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There is one approach to cover stories that I want to explicitly warn you away from, which is a roundup sort of thing.</p>
<p>In its worst form, this will be something like “meet the brokers shaping downtown real estate” that is done as, i.e., three mini-profiles.</p>
<p>I’m not opposed to the idea of doing a roundup — but the story must be explicitly conceived as such, and we have to have an detailed understanding of why we’re picking those people.</p>
<p>This roundup approach creeps in in other ways, too. Say you’re doing a story on “how development is happening in Nassau County”; that story should not be “here’s a section on recent residential developments, and here’s a section on recent warehouse developments, and here’s a section on recent retail developments.” That information can all be in the story, obviously, but the goal is to synthesize it and to move beyond “here’s what happened” and tell the reader what it means or what comes next.</p>
<p>If your story could be broken into three daily stories, that’s a roundup, not a centerpiece.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-process" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>The process<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-process"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I mentioned at the beginning that there’s a process that helps in making CPs go smoothly. Here’s how that works:</p>
<p>About five weeks before the CP is due, we’ll chat about possible ideas. The following week, in our weekly planning meeting, you’ll pitch the idea using the <a href="https://bizj.us/1qk3qi">pitch form that you can find here</a>.</p>
<p>One note on that form: The first questions asks you to tell me what the story is. What I’m looking for there is something that encapsulates the story, not something that describes it.</p>
<p>So, not <em>this is a story about economic development efforts downtown</em>. Rather, <em>this is a story of how economic development efforts downtown have failed. (or, have succeeded, or have not yet borne fruit, etc.)</em></p>
<p>I’m looking for you to dig deep and tell me the heart of this story.</p>
<p>This is the story of two star crossed lovers and how the tragedy that befell them shook Verona to its core. This is the story of how a bastard, orphan, son of a whore shaped a country. This is the story of a man chasing an impossible goal, told through the eyes of an employee helping him in the pursuit of a white whale.</p>
<p><em>This is a story about a man trying to build an empire by selling chicken wings</em>, not <em>this is a profile of Mike Rosenberger</em>. <em>This is a story about how a neighborhood is changing</em>, not <em>I want to write about new businesses in Springfield</em>. This is a story about someone getting rich by doing bad things. This is a story about someone who is trying to do good things but is getting thwarted. This is a story about how Jacksonville’s real estate sector isn’t prepared for the need for industrial space. (or it’s a story about how it is prepared, or how it is preparing, or how it has prepared but is realizing it’s not enough.)</p>
<p>If you want a reader to spend more than 20 minutes with your story, you need to be able to boil it down to something that they will care about.</p>
<p>Once we talk through your pitch, you should then begin reporting, and by the following week, have a fleshed-out plan for who you need to talk to.</p>
<p>Reporting should take up to two weeks, at which point we’ll have a conversation about what the story will look like, with the story due the following week. You will have dedicated time to do the writing on these; this is usually one or two four-hour blocks of time when you can focus on just writing.</p>
<p>The deadlines for each of the steps can be <a href="https://bizj.us/1qk3ql">found here</a>.</p>
<p>Hitting those deadlines and filling out the form at each of the appropriate steps is important in making sure that everything progresses smoothly.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-thoughts-2" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Final thoughts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#final-thoughts-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of time talking about how to do centerpieces well because they play a key role in the journalism we do.</p>
<p>That said, I want to end on a very important note: Centerpieces shouldn’t be scary, and they usually are not massive projects. Most of them will take about 16 hours of work, plus the time dealing with edits; doing one a month, you’ll spend three hours a week reporting the story out, crunching data, etc. and then spend half a day or so writing it.</p>
<p>It is very important that you work on these stories on an ongoing basis: It doesn’t work if you try to just knock them out the day or two before they are due. Deadlines are very important to this process. I tend to put a lot of editing time into cover stories, and we need to make sure we include time for that to happen.</p>
<p>Overall, cover stories can be one of the most fun things you do. When you eventually move on, you should do so with a portfolio filled with articles that show strong sourcing, creative idea development, in-depth reporting and top-notch writing. cover stories should showcase the best of our journalism.</p>
<p>They should be robust, they should drive the conversations we think our audience should be having, and they should fully display the depth of your sourcing and breadth of your reporting — all with the goal of having you create work that you’re the proudest of.</p>
