</h1>
<p>The focus of reporting at the JBJ is digging out information from our sources and, secondarily, from records.</p>
<p>That said, we do cover a decent amount of meetings, speeches and press conferences — if for no other reasons than doing so helps make sure we stay on top of the topics we cover and because they should be easy stories to produce.</p>
<p><em>That</em> said, most reporters cover these things wrong. They write boring stories and take too long to write them. They don’t take advantage of the reporting opportunities presented by such events. They think they’ve accomplished something by sitting through four hours of bullshit and turning that into 500 words of bullshit … which is not the reason any of us got into this business.</p>
<p>So how do you cover meetings, et al, properly? Let’s go through the steps.</p>
<p>One note: I use “meetings” as a catchall for the next bit, because I got tired of typing meetings, speeches and press conferences. Most of what I have to say applies to all three; I’ll pull out some specific stuff toward the end.</p>
<div id="preparing-for-meetings" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Preparing for meetings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preparing-for-meetings"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>If you’re going to cover a meeting, a speech or a press conference you should almost always do a preview.</p>
<p>For meetings, this means getting the agenda ahead of time and seeing what might be interesting. For speeches and panels, you should try to get the key person on the phone for an interview beforehand. For press conferences, you should try to get the news on an embargoed basis.</p>
<p>This will help make sure you’re fully aware of what is expected to take place at the event, and should make writing the follow-up story easier; the “after” story might simply be topping off and adding quotes to the “before” story.</p>
<p>All of that assumes that there is something interesting going on at the meeting. If not, you still might want to attend — for background purposes, for sourcing, etc. — but you should go into the meeting knowing that.</p>
</div>
<div id="writing-the-story" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Writing the story<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#writing-the-story"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>You should never assume that a meeting in itself is worth a story. (As in, don’t put “XYZ meeting” on your budget as a story.) Meetings aren’t news; what happens at them may be.</p>
<p>Meetings, speeches and panels are boxes that (may) contain news. Far too many reporters focus on the box and not what is inside.</p>
<p>Too often, it’s easy to treat meetings as <em>events</em>, as things that are being covered. Occasionally they are, but most of the time, you should approach them as though someone else is doing an extended interview and you’re pulling the news out of it.</p>
<p>I find my coverage radically changed when I had that realization. You’re not watching a thing happen and writing about it; you’re writing about a thing and the meeting or press conference is given you material for your story.</p>
<p>The fact that a meeting happened, even the fact that a vote was taken – that’s not the news. The news is what that vote means or, in the case of a speech, what the audience can do with whatever was talked about.</p>
<p>To give an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The City Council voted 17-2 to raise the fees charged by the city on commercial water connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a <em>process</em> story. There’s not thing in there that matters to readers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each new building in Duval County will be hit with a higher charge for water connections, with the change going in effect in June.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The new fee comes after a 17-2 vote by City Council on Wednesday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a story about a newsworthy thing, with the process just a component of the story.</p>
<p>For the press conference version of this point, you don’t want to do</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jacksonville Historical Society unveiled a plan for a museum of local music at a press conference at the site on Tuesday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>rather, I’d prefer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jacksonville has a long history with Southern rock, blues and other musical genres — but that past is rarely celebrated.</p>
<p>That may soon change.</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Historical Society is planning a museum of local music, unveiling plans for the facility on Tuesday.</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="covering-the-event" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Covering the event<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#covering-the-event"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind about meetings, speeches, press conferences, etc., is that they’re commodity news: Other people will probably be covering them as well.</p>
<p>That means that for the story to be valuable it has to be published quickly — and, since these aren’t stories that you’re digging stuff out on, they shouldn’t be stories that you spend an inordinate amount of time on.</p>
<p>So how do you cover these sorts of things quickly?</p>
<p>The process I use involves having two files open, one for notes and one for the story.</p>
<p>As the event is unfolding, you’re taking notes — details, quotes, vote totals, etc. — in the first file, and you’re beginning to write the story in the second one. At any point in the meeting, you could clean up what you have in the story file and have something at least somewhat publishable.</p>
<p>If the meeting starts out with a public comment period, your notes file might have a bunch of quotes from people talking. After about 20 minutes of that, you might type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Angry construction company executives pushed back against a proposed change in how much water connections will cost for new buildings during a JEA board meeting Monday.</p>
<p>“I’m angry about these changes,” Bob Smith said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, as more time goes on, your lede changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JEA board members think they’ve given the construction community enough time to prepare for an impending change in water connection fees, saying Monday that the change is long overdue.</p>
<p>“We’re charging less than it costs us to install the meters,” board Chairman Sally Brown said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Her comments came after angry construction company executives pushed back against the proposal during Monday’s board meeting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the time the meeting is done, you have a more-or-less finished story. It will have to be cleaned up; there will probably be redundancies and a lack of transitions. By and large, though, the story is done.</p>
<p>Speeches work the same. I covered the most recent mayoral inauguration, and finalizing the story took about 20 minutes after the event wrapped.</p>
<p>Notice that you have to be fully engaged during the thing you’re covering. If you ever say “I have to listen to the recording” after a meeting, speech, panel or press conference to know what the story is, something has gone wrong. Sure, record the event to make sure you get the quotes and other details correct, but you shouldn’t need that to write the story.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-event-might-not-be-the-most-important-thing" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>The event might not be the most important thing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-event-might-not-be-the-most-important-thing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Even when there is actual news being committed at a meeting, speech, panel or press conference, that’s rarely the most important thing.</p>
<p><em>You have a room full of people who just made news</em> — take advantage of that opportunity.</p>
<p>The best stories from events like this often come <em>after</em> the event; it’s you shoving your recorder in the face of the board chairman or asking the speaker to expand upon a point she made or setting up lunch with the most interesting panelist so you can get a story a week later.</p>
<p>One advantage in writing the story as you go along is you can use the after-event time to make connections or get an interview that elevates the story above the commodity coverage.</p>
<p>Your goal in covering any sort of event is to find the real news that is lurking behind whatever is happening on stage and then figure out how to build on that both in the initial coverage and for future stories. It can be more work in the moment, but the payoff is that you’re doing real journalism, not just stenography.</p>
