<p>Over the years, I’ve pulled together some books and other resources that can be helpful in getting up to speed on business reporting and on Jacksonville. I have copies of all of these and you can borrow them once you get here — I used to recommend buying some of them, but most of them are out of print and the prices are nuts.</p>
<div id="business-reporting" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Business Reporting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#business-reporting"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>While it is ancient now, one of the best guides to the basics of the business world is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Street-Journal-Guide-Understanding-Investing/dp/0684869020">The Wall Street Journal Guide to Money and Investing</a>. Despite its age, it’s still a good overview of how companies, finance and markets work.</p>
<p>Your focus will be general business rather than finance, but it will be important to understand how business finance works and what financial statements tell you about the companies you cover. To that end, I would strongly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Financial-Statements-Journalists-Guide/dp/0972993738/ref=sr_1_1">Understanding Financial Statements: A Journalist’s Guide</a>, an indispensable resource for making numbers less scary.</p>
<p>A companion to Financial Statements is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Math-Tools-Journalists-Kathleen-Wickham/dp/0916242919/ref=sr_1_2">Math Tools for Journalists</a>, which is useful no matter your beat (and just came out with a revised edition!) This seems to still be available cheaply and may be worth picking up.</p>
<p>A great (although somewhat dated) guide to business reporting is Chris Roush’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Show-Money-Economics-Communication-Routledge/dp/0805849556/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0">Show Me the Money</a>. I have a copy you can read once you get here; the newest edition is pricy, but you can get the older edition for a few bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloomberg-Way-Guide-Reporters-Editors/dp/1118030176/ref=sr_1_1">The Bloomberg Way</a> is the in-house guide that Bloomberg uses. There’s a lot of helpful information in it that applies broadly to what we do.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for examples of good business reporting, I used to recommend the <a href="https://www.foxtalebookshoppe.com/search/Starkman%2C%20Dean?type=author">Best Business Writing</a> series … but they stopped publishing them about eight years ago. (The stories still stand up and can be good for inspiration, and you can find used copies <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=starkman+dean&amp;crid=180T8U6GUGQ50&amp;sprefix=starkman+dean%2Caps%2C88&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss">for a few bucks</a>.)</p>
<p>For more recent examples of great business reporting. check out SABEW’s <a href="https://sabew.org/contestsawards/best-in-business-past-honorees/">Best in Business winners</a> and the <a href="http://theloebawards.com/">Loeb Award winners</a>. You can also find examples of good reporting at Bloomberg’s annual <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bloomberg+jealousy+list&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1022US1022&amp;oq=bloomberg+jealous&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggBEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg5MgYIARBFGDvSAQg0MTgyajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Jealousy List</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/">Investopedia</a> is a great resource for definitions, explainers and other articles that might help you make more sense of the world of business. If you’re stuck on what a term means or want to do a deeper dive into a subject, that site is a good first stop.</p>
<p>Moving to writing —</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Craft-Feature-Writing-Journal/dp/0452261589/ref=sr_1_1">The Art and Craft of Feature Writing</a> is one of my favorite resources for longer-form writing and can be helpful in aiding in conceptualizing things like centerpieces. It’s based on the Wall Street Journal’s in-house writing guide and, despite its name, is fairly hard-news focused.</p>
<p>I’m also a big fan of James Stewart’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Follow-Story-Write-Successful-Nonfiction/dp/0684850672/ref=sr_1_1">Follow the Story</a>, which is great for longer-form enterprise or investigative stories.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to book recommendations, Roy Peter Clark’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Tools-Essential-Strategies-Writer/dp/0316014990/ref=sr_1_1">Writing Tools</a> is a book I dip into every week or so as a sort of reminder of best practices. (I’m a fan of Clark’s teaching on writing in general; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Murder-Your-Darlings-Writing-Aristotle/dp/0316481882/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0">Murder Your Darlings</a> is another recommendation.)</p>
<p>My last reading suggestion is an article written for the Poynter Institute almost two decades ago by Diana Sugg, who won the Pulitzer Prize for beat reporting in 2003. In <a href="https://acbj-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tgibbons_bizjournals_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Ftgibbons%5Fbizjournals%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FTurn%20the%20Beat%20Around%5FPoynter%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fpersonal%2Ftgibbons%5Fbizjournals%5Fcom%2FDocuments">this piece</a>, she talks about how to cover a beat successfully. Many things have changed since that was published, of course, but the heart of it remains true; I re-read it every year, and every year, it offers new inspiration.</p>

<div id="jacksonville" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Jacksonville<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#jacksonville"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>If you want to understand Jacksonville, the three books to read are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Revolution-Consolidation-Jacksonville-Duval-Political/dp/0578565927/ref=sr_1_1">Quiet Revolution</a> - a look at when and why Jacksonville consolidated and — in the recently updated version — an examination of how that decision has shaped modern Jacksonville.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Personal-Account-Demonstrations-Jacksonville-Saturday/dp/1595941959/ref=sr_1_1">It Was Never About a Hot Dog and a Coke</a> - a sit-in that led to a vicious attack on members of the Jacksonville Youth Council NAACP was an important moment in the history of Jacksonville (and the Civil Rights Movement). This account by one of the demonstrators (and Hurst’s other books) are essential to an understanding of the city.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Old-Hickorys-Town-Illustrated-Jacksonville/dp/B000OL8E9O/ref=sr_1_1">Old Hickory’s Town</a> - this is a good general overview of the area’s development.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re interested in architecture, I used to suggest checking out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Henry-John-Klutho-Jacksonville/dp/0813007313/ref=sr_1_1">The Architecture of Henry Klutho</a> — but that is now hideously expensive. It might be worth picking up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Walking-Tour-Jacksonville-Florida-America-ebook/dp/B005C470GG/ref=sr_1_4">A Walking Tour of Jacksonville</a> for a buck.</p>
<p>Bill Delaney’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Jacksonville-Guide-Wonderful-Obscure/dp/1681063344/ref=sr_1_1">Secret Jacksonville</a> will take you down some interesting paths and give you a different understanding of the city. In a similar vein, anything by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Tim-Gilmore/author/B00908FHS8">Tim Gilmore</a> will give you insight into less-talked about parts of Jacksonville and its history.</p>
<p>If you have a thing for Southern rock, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/As-Recall-Jacksonvilles-American-History/dp/1530443024/ref=sr_1_1">As I Recall</a> is decent look at the area’s musical history. I haven’t read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jacksonville-Roots-Southern-Michael-FitzGerald/dp/0813080355/ref=sr_1_2">Jacksonville and the Roots of Southern Rock</a>, but the reviews are good.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most celebrated resident of Jacksonville was James Weldon Johnson; his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Writings-Johnson-Library-Classics/dp/0812975324/ref=sr_1_1">Essential Writings</a> is worth your time.</p>
<p>There’s not a lot of novels set in Jacksonville — although Michael Wiley’s noir-ish <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PLPNSCH">Daniel Turner mystery series</a> is, and is decent. To understand Florida writ large, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Carl-Hiaasen/author/B00KWZGGAG">Carl Hiaasen</a> is a must read.</p>
<p>While the city’s main newspaper is the Times-Union, it hasn’t focused on business much in recent years. Particular people to pay attention to there are Alexandria Mansfield, who covers development; David Bauerlein, who covers a range of things we also care about; and Teresa Stepzinski, who covers restaurant news. Nate Monroe’s columns are a good, very opinionated take on Jacksonville politics.</p>
<p>Our main competition in the real estate space is the Jacksonville News and Daily Record, which does a great job, particularly on downtown. You should be reading them regularly.</p>
<p>St. Johns County, to the south, is a big part of our coverage area. The daily paper there is the St. Augustine Record. Other outlying media include the Nassau County Record and Clay Today. It is worth keeping an eye on them for projects that might be beneath our radar but that have regional impact.</p>
<p>Other media in the area that I keep an eye on include WJCT News — which has really been leaning into news coverage recently — as well as The Jaxson, The Coastal, Edible Northeast Florida, Jacksonville Magazine and Folio Weekly.</p>
