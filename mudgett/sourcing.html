<h2>Why sourcing matters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-sourcing-matters"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>What is the most important thing on the minds on the people running the companies in the industries you cover? What fears and hopes do the people interacting with those industries have? Who are the movers and shakers? How are they about to move and shake? What stories do they want told? What stories do they not want told?</p>
<p>How do all of those things affect the broader Jacksonville business community? How does it affect investors? How does it affect minority communities? How does it affect other industries? How does it affect those in power, those who want to be in power, those who are powerless?</p>
<p>What is coming that people need to be prepared for? Suppliers, shippers, brokers, builders, retailers, customers, investors, executives, residents — what do they need to know to understand Jacksonville’s economy and what’s on the horizon?</p>
<div id="sourcingbox" class="greybox" title="Onboarding Path">
<p>This might be the most important section in this entire document. To do the journalism the JBJ aspires to, you <em>must</em> be well sourced. Sourcing will be a regular part of our one-on-one conversations and should be <em>the</em> main thing you do over your first weeks here.</p>
</div>
<p>I’m going to spend a lot of time throughout this document talking about sourcing, and the reason is all of those questions above. <em>You can’t answer them by looking at press releases. You can’t answer them by talking to flaks. You can’t answer them by looking at data without having a person provide context. You can’t answer them while sitting in the newsroom.</em></p>
<p>Answering those questions is our purpose, and that means you need to get out of the office and forge relationships with those who can help you understand what questions need to be asked and what the answers are.</p>
<p>Like any media organization, we have a decent amount of flotsam. To keep the beast fed, you’re going to do some briefs (quickly; we’ll talk about that later.) You’re going to do some Q-and-As and cover some meetings and rewrite some press releases (again, quickly, and more later).</p>
<p>But the thing that got you into this business — or at least the thing that has you working here — is that I believe you want to break news and own stories and lead conversations. You want to be first and best a lot of the time, and at least one of those the rest of the time.</p>
<p>The only way you can do that is by sourcing. I’ll be blunt: If you can’t source, this is not the job for you. That doesn’t mean you have to source in the exact same way I or other ACBJ journalists source. What it does mean is that you have to work, from the get go, at building up a source network that will let you answer the questions we started with, that will enable you to break news, explain why it matters and prepare our readers for the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-i-mean-by-sourcing" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>What I mean by sourcing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-i-mean-by-sourcing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Depending on your background and experience level, you might be a little hazy on what I mean by sourcing, so let me play that out.</p>
<p>Business reporting presents some different challenges compared to other beats (I’m not saying it’s harder, just different.) Most of what we cover is not place bound; there’s not a locker room to visit or a city hall to hang out at. While we do cover some meetings, doing so is not a focus, which takes away a contact point. Finally — and somewhat paradoxically — forging the connections you need can be harder on a business beat because there are many people looking to give you the information <em>they</em> want you to have; navigating around gatekeepers is vital.</p>
<p>So sourcing is not getting on the distribution list of PR people or attending board meetings or interviewing people. You should do all of those things, of course, but the goal is to go deeper.</p>
<p>Sourcing is developing a relationship with people who can tell you what is truly happening on the topics you care about. If someone is a source, you can reach them when they’re on vacation if something big is happening. If someone is a source, they’ll tell you things before the information is public — before the press release goes out or the lawsuit is filed or the record is released.</p>
<p>You are well sourced when you have information that isn’t being pushed out — not necessarily secret information, but information that you have gleaned from talking to the people involved in the story. You are well sourced when people call you back at difficult times.</p>
<p>You are well sourced when you have an in-depth knowledge of the beat — when you can confidently say “these are the issues that matter on the topics I cover.”</p>
<p>We’ll talk about idea generation a bit later, but two points that matters in this context: First, after your first few weeks on the job, you should start having a list of stories you’re chasing — things that you hear are happening or will happen that you can’t nail down yet.</p>
<p>The nailing down is both a sourcing and reporting task; for now, though, focus on the first part of that statement: You need to be connected with people enough that you know things are out there to chase. Second, and we’ll discuss this when it comes to pitching stories, but your objective is to have most of your pitches start out with some variant of “<sources> told me.” <em>That</em> is the overall goal of all of this.</sources></p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-start-developing-sources" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>How to start developing sources<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-start-developing-sources"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Sourcing is building a relationship, and that relationship is going to start with you reaching out to many people in your first few weeks here.</p>
<p>The initial list of people you reach out to will be comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a list of the first people you should reach out to, which you’ll get a few days after starting</li>
<li>whatever names you came up with during your morgue dive — essentially people that have been written about recently by us or others</li>
<li>people at the top companies on the Lists that you care about</li>
</ul>
<p>Each day for the next few weeks, you should call (preferably), text (depending on the person) or email (if all else fails) at least three people who you want to get to know. The goal is to reach out to 50 or so people in the first month you are here.</p>
<p>(There is a window here: Badgering someone to meet with you in the first three months is natural: “You’re an important person who I need to know to do my job; we should talk.” That pitch is harder when you’ve been here for six months and have never reached out.)</p>
<p>The goal of that initial contact is to at least get a phone conversation. Ideally, you want to schedule in-person meetings with as many people as possible — breakfasts, lunches, coffees, drinks, drop-ins at their office, anything that gets you spending time with the person.</p>
<p>Let me note: This isn’t easy. Getting in touch with a PR person is simple, but getting lunch with a CEO will require perseverance.</p>
<p>By your second month here, you should be looking to have three in-person meetings each week; by the end of your 90 days, you should have had in-person meetings with at least two dozen people and reached out to 100.</p>
</div>
<div id="sourcing-is-not-reporting" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Sourcing is not reporting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sourcing-is-not-reporting"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>During those in-person meetings (or on the phone, if that’s all you can get), there’s two things you’re looking to accomplish:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start to develop a relationship. You want to come away from these meetings with the person’s cell phone number and an understanding that you’ll be back in touch. You need to convey that you’re interested in what they do.
<ul>
<li>You want them to know that you care about their company and industry and want them to come to you with news.</li>
<li>You want them to begin to trust you. This involves you showing an interest and knowledge of what they do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Begin to gain information about them, their organization and your beat in general. The questions I go into these meetings with are
<ul>
<li>How is your business doing? What’s been some recent things of note? (Of course, you should have read up on the company beforehand if possible, and already know anything big that has happened.)</li>
<li>What are they looking forward to?</li>
<li>What are the major issues happening in their industry?</li>
<li>What stories do they think you should be covering?</li>
<li>Who else do they think you should talk to?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that that list of information very likely does <em>not</em> lead directly to a story. If in the conversation the proto-source says something that feels like it should be written about now, puruse that; I’m not saying to leave stories on the table.</p>
<p>What I am doing is drawing a distinction between <em>sourcing</em> and <em>interviewing</em>.</p>
<p>Most of reporting life is spent interviewing people — getting information from people (sources and others) directly for a story. That should be part of your professional relationship with sources, but interviewing doesn’t do a lot to build the relationship. One way of analogizing it: Sourcing is like inviting someone over for a cookout. You might ask them to pick up ice on the way over, but the focus of the interaction is building the relationship. Interviewing is like asking them to help you move.</p>
<p>If you only talk to people when you need them for a story, they’re not a source.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-do-you-source-with" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Who do you source with<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#who-do-you-source-with"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Everyone.</p>
<p>I mean this slightly tongue in cheek, but only a little. Everyone is a source: You want the CEO, you want the junior person just starting out, you want the truck driver, you want the head of the department and the worker bee and the executive. How you manage these relationships will be different depending on the person, and the job, etc., but you want people in the C-suite and people on the shop floor and everywhere in between.</p>
<p>“Everyone” isn’t terribly helpful in thinking through sourcing, though, so let me give you two useful ways to think through who to reach out to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Follow the process. Pretty much everything we cover is part of a chain of events. You want sources at every link in that chain.
<ul>
<li>A building is being built. Who is part of that chain? There’s the developer behind the project, the engineers and architects who design the structure, the lawyers who get it through the system, the construction company that builds it, the broker that leases it, the other broker that sells it, and more. You want connections at each of those points.</li>
<li>An item is being imported. Who is part of that chain? There’s a customer who orders it, a broker who arranges transportation, a shipping company that gets it to Jacksonville, a trucking company that brings it to a warehouse, a warehouse operator that stores it …</li>
<li>A restaurant is opening. Chef with an idea, broker who finds space, designer who shapes the space, contractor who builds it out, social media person who makes sure we know about it …</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Think of levels. This is like the vertical version of thinking through the process.
<ul>
<li>The general contractor building the building has subs; the subs have employees. The contractor is probably part of a trade group.</li>
<li>A restaruant group has the CEO, and the chefs at the indiviual restaurants.</li>
<li>A railroad has the executives, and the division heads, and the union chefs, and the workers …</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you go over your initial list of contacts and start turning them into sources, you’ll start developing a schematic of the beat. Take some time and look for holes: Are there people at certain points in the chain or at certain levels that you’re missing?</p>
<p>One note: In general, PR people are not going to be your best sources. PR people, by and large, are not sources. A CEO can be a source. A division head can be a source. A train conductor can be a source. The person paid to tell you what the company wants you to hear is not a source.</p>
<p>That isn’t a blanket statement; there are definitely some PR people who may serve a sourcing role, and others who, while they may not be sources, are helpful people to know.</p>
<p>What you’re looking for in a source is someone who know things that aren’t out there yet and will tell you those things. I’m not saying you’re going after the Pentagon Papers, but if the person is just giving you the information that they’re supposed to, you don’t need a relationship with them.</p>
<p>While talking about PR people — I bang on about getting people’s cell phones, and this is why. On a very basic level, if you can’t reach them — if you have to go through a PR person, if you can only reach them in the office — they’re not a source. If they don’t answer when you call, they’re not a source, either.</p>
</div>
<div id="rinse-and-repeat" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Rinse and repeat<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rinse-and-repeat"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>OK, so you’ve spent your first few weeks calling/texting/emailing. You’ve continued doing that (at a lesser rate) in the next few weeks while adding in-person meetings to the mix.</p>
<p>By the end of your first 90 days, you’ve reached out to 100 people and met with a few dozen.</p>
<p>Then you have to keep the flywheel turning.</p>
<p>By the end of the first three months, you’ll be circling back to some of those initial contacts. You’ll have the people you click the most with, you’ll have the people who give you the best information, you’ll have the beginning of some source relationships. Now you have to build them, through texts, calls and meetings.</p>
<p>As you settle into your beat, the expectation is that you’ll have at least two in-person sourcing meetings a week, and regular texts and phone calls. A simple metric: Call or text at least two sources every day (we can talk about strategies, but approaches will differ depending on the person), and set aside time once a week to schedule in-person meetings.</p>
<p>You have to immerse yourself in your beat in other ways, as well. You should be reading what your sources read (trade publications, social media accounts, etc.), looking for things that will give you an excuse to reach out. (“I saw that X is happening in Boise. You know if anything like that is going on here” or “I saw that your company got an award for safety. That’s pretty cool. Figured I’d just call and say congrats.”)</p>
<p>Gatherings are also an important part of the mix. NAIOP awards and Propeller Club holiday parties and Women’s Food Alliance meetings … going to these things will help build the relationship, will enable you to find more people and will make it easier to reach out to those people to chat.</p>
<p>I said earlier that interviewing isn’t sourcing — but that doesn’t mean you can’t use an interview as an entree point. Call up the CEO to set up time to stop by for a Q-and-A, giving you some facetime. Get their cell phone number. Call them up to see what they think about a thing. Set up lunch. Call them or text them every few weeks to touch base and to build the relationship.</p>
<p>You also have to make sure you don’t plateau. Sure, you have one cold-storage person and one office broker and one restaurateur you have a good relationship with. You’re still building your network. You should reach out to some of the people you connected with earlier and continue building your budding relationships.</p>
<p>Time is a vital part of the sourcing process, to be sure: By the end of your first year here, you should have a solid, robust base.</p>
<p>But you can’t expect sources to just accrete. For many reporters, sourcing can be challenging. Half our time is spent in our own head, focused on a computer screen. Making sourcing a constant and regular part of your workday will pay off with huge dividends.</p>
</div>
<div id="keeping-track" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Keeping track<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#keeping-track"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>One final thing: As you’re going through your sourcing journey, it’s important to keep track of everyone you speak with — for your benefit and for the benefit of the rest of the staff.</p>
<p>To help with that, you should log your sourcing activity in <a href="https://acbj-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/tgibbons_bizjournals_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B7DE7F8A6-944D-4A13-8CAC-40945F1D0FF7%7D&amp;file=Sourcing.xlsx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true">this spreadsheet</a>. This will allow you to look back at where you’re strongly sourced and find the areas you need to shore up, will help avoid duplication of effort and will allow us to build up a stronger base for those who come after us.</p>
