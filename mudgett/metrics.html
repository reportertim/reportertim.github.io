</h1>
<p>Tracking how our work is being received by our audience is an important tool in our journalism arsenal as well as being one of the ways we’re evaluated.</p>
<p>Because of that, we will routinely talk about our metrics, aiming to make sure that we’re connecting our readers to the news that we know they need to have.</p>
<p>Different publications engage with metrics in different ways, and I think it’s useful for you to understand the approach we take at the JBJ. Here are some of the key principals in how I think about the numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The metrics are important</em>: This might seem obvious, but it’s important to make sure it’s understood. Making sure that our work is connecting with our audience is vital; if no one is reading what we’re doing, we’re wasting our time. While an over-reliance on metrics could lead us to take our eye off the focus on good journalism, it’s important that we pay close attention to them.</li>
<li>
<em>Metrics are not (necessarily) a measure of quality … but …</em>: It is very possible to do great work and have no one read it. If that happens, though, <em>we’re doing something wrong</em>; if we know the work is important, we have to figure out <em>why</em> it’s not being read — should there be a different headline, was the timing off, should the angle of reporting change, did we present it properly on social … . If you want to cover something, and we know it won’t be read, there needs to be a conversation to address that or there’s no point in doing the story.</li>
<li>
<em>Metrics should help guide your idea generation</em>: We have a good sense of what our readers are coming to us for, and looking at what stories are hitting and which are missing can help sharpen that sense. While the numbers are not the only thing that goes into shaping our coverage, knowing what readers are engaging with can provide direction.</li>
<li>
<em>Hitting our goals is a team task</em>: Some markets have individual goals; the JBJ does not. Achieving the marks set out for us requires all of us to work together. We will look at how reporters are doing individually as well as as a team, but this is with the understanding that different beats, the ebb and flow of news and other things do play a role in the numbers that result.</li>
</ul>
<div id="what-were-looking-at" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>What we’re looking at<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-were-looking-at"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We pay attention to four main metrics: the number of people reading a story (visits), the number of people who need the news we present enough to pay for it (conversions), the number of people coming to our work through Morning and Afternoon Edition (email) and the number of people arriving from search, as direct visits to our site and through Breaking News emails (high-value visits).</p>
<p>On a daily basis, the main ones we focus on are visits and conversions: Are we digging out news that people are reading and that they need to read enough that they’ll pay for it?</p>
<p>That question should play a key role in how you think about the stories you’re doing. The focus isn’t on the numbers; the focus should be on serving our readers … and if we do that, the numbers will follow.</p>
<p>On a regular basis, I’ll update you on how we’re doing compared to our goals. You are encouraged to look at the metrics (through <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/home?experience=power-bi">PowerBI</a>, logging in with your general Bizjournals account) on a regular basis.</p>
