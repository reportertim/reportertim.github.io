<span class="header-section-number">16</span> Writing With Authority<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#writing-with-authority"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h1>
<p>Your goal as a reporter is to tell people stuff they don’t know that they should know.</p>
<p>Here’s the rub: Readers have no idea what you’re talking about. They don’t know where the North Core is, they’re confused about the difference between the Southbank and Southside, they don’t understand why bigger ships coming into the port matter, they don’t want to deal with newfangled technology.</p>
<p>This isn’t because they’re dumb.</p>
<p>It’s because they’re busy.</p>
<p>Our readers are taking the information we provide and applying it in lives that are filled with unchecked-off to-do lists. They’re looking to grow their business, advance their careers and play a significant role in shaping the local economy … and maybe have a smidgen of “work-life balance” at the same time. They need the information we provide in order to do that … but they might not know what they need.</p>
<p>That’s where writing with authority comes into play. Our job as Jacksonville Business Journal reporters is to find the information that our readers need and write it in such a way <em>that their need for it is evident</em>.</p>
<p>The goal is to have you write confidently and authoritatively, to be the reporter who is driving the conversation and writing things readers need to know.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the other rub: <em>You</em> might have not idea what you’re talking about.</strong></p>
<p>It’s all good and well to say you need to write with authority … but you’re a new reporter or covering a new beat; <em>you don’t have authority.</em></p>
<p>If you’re to do your job well, you need to master your beat and write stories that readers need to read. Everything in this document so far is aiming at that goal: It’s why sourcing is vital, it’s why you need to be creative in coming up with story ideas, it’s why you need to know what your stories matter, it’s what you need to be able to confidentially do a q-and-a and cover a meeting.</p>
<p>Writing with authority will take time — but, like with sourcing, it’s not something that will just happen. If you approach it right, you can start operating at a higher level sooner, to the benefit of both your readers and your journalism.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it</p>
<div id="be-fearful-in-reporting" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Be fearful in reporting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#be-fearful-in-reporting"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Here’s a baseline starting point: Every interview you do, every meeting you cover, every report you read - you should assume that you’re on the precipice of screwing things up. You’re about to misunderstand context, you’re about to not get important numbers, you’re about to talk to the wrong person.</p>
<p>You should assume that because that is likely to be reality, at least for the beginning of your time here.</p>
<p>That sounds bad, but it’s actually a perfectly acceptable reality to be in, <em>as long as you’re aware of it</em>. If you go into reporting assuming that you’re one mistake away from being fired, you’ll have the mindset that will stop that from happening.</p>
<p>Always doubt yourself. Always doubt your sources. Always assume that you don’t quite get it, that you might not have heard things correctly, that your analysis is wrong — and then fix that situation: Check with sources to see if your understanding is correct, read your nut graf to a key source to see if your take is accurate, ask another source if the numbers seem right.</p>
<p>“Call one more source, ask one more question, write one more story,” as I was told early in my career. That means staying after the meeting to talk to board members. It means calling a person you haven’t talked to before and seeing what they think of the common wisdom. It means playing devil’s advocate when asking questions. It means making sure you have more details and more information than you think you need, because you don’t yet know which are the details that you do need.</p>
<p>Assume that you’re wrong until you get to a point where you <em>know</em> you’re right (and know that that point is going to be further along than you want it to be).</p>
</div>
<div id="it-starts-with-sourcing" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>It starts with sourcing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#it-starts-with-sourcing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I talked about sourcing early on in this document, and I’ll return to it here: The more people you talk to — and the more you <em>talk</em> to them, not just interview them — the more assured you can be in your writing.</p>
<p>If you can confidently say “sources are saying” — meaning you have sources, and they’re saying things, and you have other sources you’re checking that against — then you should be able to write with an embued authority.</p>
</div>
<div id="details-matter" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Details matter<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#details-matter"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Even before you get to that level of sourcing, though, you can write authortatively by mastering the content of each individual story. To do that, details matter.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important area of details, and also the easiest: numbers. What’s the square footage, how much was the contract for, what’s the revenue breakdown, how many years will the project take … Business is a game of numbers, and business reporting means explicating those numbers; anytime you’re interviewing someone who lays out something that can be quantified, you should push for that quantification. (And if they don’t give it, push for it in other ways: Many businesses won’t tell you what their revenue goal is, say, but they might be willing to tell you the percentage increase they’re aiming for.)</p>
<p>The idea is to go as granular as possible in your reporting. Someone tells you they’re opening a business in Jacksonville, you ask what neighborhood; they say their office will be in a particular tower, you ask what floor.</p>
<p>A CEO says they’ve been working on a project “for a while”; you stop them and ask when the conversations started and how did they go and what were the roadblocks and how did they come to a final decision.</p>
<p><em>Little of that might end up in your story</em>. You’re not trying to overwhelm the reader with extraneous information; you’re asking because it will allow you to write from a position of strength.</p>
<p>Details are at the heart of our reporting. You want to know how a chef is rolling out a new menu; readers want to know how that menu was costed out. You need to know how the economics were thought through, even if it ends up as just half a sentence in the story.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-the-documents" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Get the documents<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#get-the-documents"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I’ll start with a personal peeve on this point: I’ll be editing a story on “Company X was hired by the city to do Y” … and the story doesn’t say how much they’re getting paid or when the RFP went out or when the work is due.</p>
<p>Some of what I’m looking for is covered by getting the details; the rest is covered by the idea of <em>get the contract</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re writing about anything that touches on a public entity, working on that story should generate a public records request: There’s the document itself, there’s emails that led up to the document, there’s records related to the document … <em>Request them.</em> <strong><em>Request them all.</em></strong> Don’t worry about a PAO saying you’re on a fishing expedition; that’s the way to catch fish.</p>
<p>We’re fortunate to be working in a state with good (and always under attack) public record laws — but those laws don’t matter if we don’t avail ourselves of them.</p>
<p>Stepping back to my personal pet peeve: Even if there are not public records, or you haven’t gotten them yet, you should be asking for details on everything you write. The records will illuminate the story but might not be released in time for the first piece; the person you’re talking to should be able to tell you cost, deadline and scope of any project, however … if they can’t, that fact likely should be in the story.</p>
</div>
<div id="dont-write-stupid-stuff" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Don’t write stupid stuff<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dont-write-stupid-stuff"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This might be obvious, but I’ve been doing this long enough that I’ll state it baldly: If you don’t understand something, don’t put it in a story.</p>
<p>Don’t quote something under the assumption that it has to be right because it’s a quote. Don’t include numbers because someone acted like they’re important. Don’t confidently state that a thing happened unless you understand what the thing was and why it happened.</p>
<p>You are writing a story based on what sources tell you, but the sources are not writing the story. You need to understand what happened and why it matters. If you can’t answer questions about a topic, you don’t understand it, and therefore shouldn’t write about.</p>
<p>This is where self-editing comes into play: Before you file a story, think through what questions you might be asked, and make sure you have the answers.</p>
<p>This applies to factual stuff as well as the “why it matters” question: If you don’t know why readers should care about something, you should either figure it out or cut it out.</p>
</div>
<div id="pick-a-lane" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Pick a lane<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pick-a-lane"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>For every story you do, you have a choice: Are you reporting from a position of strength or a position of weakness? <em>Either one is fine</em>, but you need to pick a lane.</p>
<p>If you’re reporting from a position of strength, it means you fully understand the topic. It means that when people say questionable things, you’ll challenge them. It means that you’re aiming to go beyond the surface with the story.</p>
<p>From a position of weakness, you’re looking for sources to explain things to you; you’re giving up some amount of control. This can be good: A position of weakness does not mean you take whatever is given to you, it just means that you’re pushing sources to explain rather than defend. It can actually be useful to take an “explain it to me like I’m 5” approach even when you fully understand something; it can stroke a source’s ego, and it can force them to go to a more basic level of explaining something.</p>
<p>That said, you need to know which lane you’re in when you’re writing. Don’t keyboard warrior a story that you’re iffy about. Yes, the goal is to write with authority … but if you don’t feel you’ve gotten to that point on a particular story, you can’t fake it.</p>
</div>
<div id="just-dont" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Just don’t<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#just-dont"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>When reporters are pursuing the goal to write authoritatively, sometimes that leads to stories that have a veneer of authority but not the substance. Don’t do that.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t write anything you don’t understand. I referred to this earlier, and it seems like an obvious thing to avoid, but it absolutely will crop up: A source said something in an interview and then had to leave, a measure got passed in a meeting, a report was released and there’s no one around to talk to … and, boom, you’ve written a story that doesn’t make sense to you but you hope will fool readers. Don’t do this. If you’re going down this path, call a source or talk to an editor. <em>I would rather miss a story then publish something wrong</em>, and if you’re pretending you understand something that you don’t, the chance of a mistake is unacceptably high.</li>
<li>Don’t write anything you can’t back up. Related to the previous point: If you say “X means Y” or “Because of X, Y,” expect to be asked how you know that. Vague answers are not acceptable.</li>
<li>Don’t write things to write things. This comes up mainly on document-driven stories: A bill was introduced, a lawsuit was filed, a press release was issued. Cool; why does it matter? If your answer to the question of “why is this news” is “it happened,” that’s a sign that you need to step back and think about why this particular piece of news might matter.</li>
<li>Don’t try to fake it with quotes or numbers. Here’s an editing secret: Really long quotes are a sign that the reporter doesn’t know what they’re talking about: Someone seemed excited when they said a bunch of words, and the reporter figured they’d be OK if they stuck to the gobbledegook. Don’t do that — and don’t do the number equivalent, which is larding up your story with a bunch of numbers just because you have them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="use-the-editors" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Use the editors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#use-the-editors"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The editing process should begin before a story is turned in — before it’s even written, in fact. As you’re going through the process of figuring out who to talk to, doing the interviews and nailing down your structure, keep the editors in the loop.</p>
<p>You should be checking in with an editor before you begin writing; depending on the story, you likely want to have a quick conversation after every interview you conduct or meeting you attend, updating the editor on what you’ve found so far and what you think is important.</p>
<p>The goal is to have questions come up earlier in the process, before you’ve written words that have to be cut and at the point where it’s easier to ask follow-up questions. Making sure you’re on the right path while you’re still on the path will make your reporting more efficient and your writing more authoritative.</p>
