<p>Being able to generate a steady stream of things to write about is vital to your job at the JBJ — not only because it is necessary to serve our readers, but also because without having that ability, the job can become a real grind. Investing time and thought into creating a continually updated list things you should and will write about — big centerpieces, quick-turn daily stories, Q-and-As, follow-up pieces and more — will make the job both more fun and more satisfying.</p>
<p>A friend of mine once referred to the constant need to come up with new ideas as “the crisis of the genre,” and it can truly feel like a crisis if you start each day hoping and praying that something shows up in your email that you can write about.</p>
<p>What follows is a way to make sure you’re not in that situation. Starting from your first few days on the job, you should begin generating a list of seeds for stories. The goal is to be at a point where you are frustrated due to having so many things to write about that you can’t get to them all, not to be stressed over being asked to come up with a story and finding the larder bare.</p>
<div id="ideabox" class="greybox" title="Onboarding Path">
<p>This section will start being important about six weeks in — you’ve plucked the low-hanging fruit, you’ve gotten your feet under you and you’re ready to start doing meatier stories. But what are those stories? The process laid out here should help you come up with a robust list.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-an-idea" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>What is an idea?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-an-idea"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I’m using the term <em>idea</em> in a very specific fashion in this discussion, so let me stop for a moment and make clear what I mean: An idea is a pitchable story; it likely requires more reporting, but you already has a sense of what the nut graf and headline will shape up to be. (That nut graf might change, the headline might be rewritten — but they will change <em>from</em> something …)</p>
<p>Ideas are not broad. They are not topics.</p>
<p>Coming up with <em>topics</em> is a necessary first step to coming up with what I’ll refer to as <em>seeds</em>, which in turn lead to ideas — but don’t think that figuring out broadly what area you want to write about means that you have an idea.</p>
<p>This is a key bit: As an editor, it is hard to help a reporter work through a story when the pitch is just “I want to write about <thing>.”</thing></p>
<p>So what’s a seed? Seeds are the questions you ask that, with the addition of a a bit of reporting, becomes an idea.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Technically, this section should probably be called “seed generation,” but no one would know what that meant until they read it … .&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Every act of journalism begins with a reporter or editor saying, “huh, that’s interesting.” More ambitious reporting follows that observation up with a question: “I wonder …”</p>
<p><em>I wonder if that’s a sign of a bigger problem and if I can find data to contextualize it.</em> <em>I wonder what it’s like to be the CEO doing that deal.</em> <em>I wonder what comes next after that announcement.</em> <em>I wonder why that project didn’t move ahead.</em> <em>I wonder how her opponent will react.</em> <em>…</em></p>
<p>Coming up with those questions — those seeds — is the first step toward coming up with story ideas — which is the first step in committing journalism. We have talked at length about pitching stories, how to approach public records, ways of writing efficiently and more … but without the ability to develop ideas, you’re just reacting to the news, performing stenography or flailing about in hopes that a story will fall into your lap.</p>
<p>Note the progression from beat to topic to seed to idea. Too often, reporters pitch topics and seeds as though they are ideas. Just like a topic ( <em>“We should do something on how climate change is affecting the transportation industry in Jacksonville!</em> ) is not an idea, neither is a question, even a specific question ( <em>“I wonder if new regulations on carbon emissions is making life harder for First Coast maritime companies?</em>).</p>
<p><em>I want to write about commercial real estate.</em> That’s good; that’s a beat. <em>I want to write about how downtown office towers are being affected by the shift to hybrid work.</em> That’s a very good topic, but it’s not an idea. Try again.</p>
<p><em>Huh, most of our Best Places to Work companies said workers are hybrid or remote. That’s interesting. I wonder how landlords in the urban core are dealing with that?</em> Now we’re getting closer – maybe a bit broad of a question, but workable.</p>
<p>Other questions that might occur to you from that same “huh” moment: Has the shift to remote and hybrid work had an impact on where homes are being built? Is the surge in coffee shops locating in Jacksonville related to people working not in the office? Jacksonville has a history with the staffing industry; has the shift in workplace patterns been good or bad for them?</p>
<p>Questions are the starting point; ideas are the declarative sentence that comes from answering the question. <em>“Why hasn’t the St. Augustine airport succeeded in getting commercial flights?”</em> is a great starting point for an idea, <strong>but it is not in itself an idea.</strong> <em>Political infighting has doomed efforts to get commercial flights in St. Augustine</em> is an idea. So is <em>Airlines are demanding incentives outside the scope provided by St. Johns County, so commercial flights seem unlikely</em> or <em>Here are the five reasons St. Augustine doesn’t have commercial flights and what’s being done about them.</em></p>
<p>A topic might give you multiple seeds. <em>Huh, that’s interesting: Work on the Armory project near downtown is starting up again. I wonder …</em> What? <em>I wonder why things are moving again.</em> <em>I wonder how the capital market freeze is affecting the project.</em> <em>I wonder where the city incentive package now stands.</em> Maybe those are three separate stories; maybe they all fit into one story; maybe the answer to some of that wonderment turns out not to be newsworthy. Having those seeds, though, sets you on the path to having ideas.</p>
<p>Generating ideas requires creativity and an attentiveness to detail — things that I can’t teach you. What I can teach you is a process that will set the stage for coming up with the questions that will led to a wealth of things about which you can write.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-ideas-come-from" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Where ideas come from<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#where-ideas-come-from"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There’s a tendency to think that idea generation is the province of longform journalism, of the narrative article, the investigative project, the centerpiece story. And those things obviously do need the reporter to develop ideas. But so does daily beat coverage.</p>
<p>In this context, an idea is anything you come up with. A deed being filed may result in a story, but that’s just reacting to events. Hearing that a property is up for sale and deciding to look into it is an idea. An earnings report isn’t an idea; deciding to spin off a story on the long-term prospects of the company is an idea. Covering a meeting isn’t an idea; telling our readers what will happen in that meeting before it happens is.</p>
<p>If it helps, substitute the words “things I should look into into” for “idea”: Whatever terminology you use, the point is to have a list of potential stories — hard news, profiles, analysis, context — that you plan to work on.</p>
<p>The ideas you generate are not simply things that you hope to get to at some point in the future, nor are they things that will languish on your list for weeks and months to come. With the type of urgent journalism we specialize in, your idea list should be constantly refreshed with stuff that you plan to do today and tomorrow, things you need to do this week as well as things you know needs to be written in weeks ahead.</p>
<p>As we’ll get into later, you should have things on your idea list that require a longer period of time to report out as well as things that simply won’t come to fruition for some period of time. But don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you’re just noodling around with a list of eventual stories. Remember, the point of all of this is to break news; spending time thinking about what you want to write about isn’t an excuse to be behind the curve.</p>
<p>So how do you come up with a list of things you need to/want to/plan to write about? Let’s talk about some ways of thinking about what you’re trying to accomplish and then go through a more formal process.</p>
<p>There are four ways to develop this list of things you want to write about: cultivation, curation, capturing and creating.</p>
<p>Less alliteratively:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sourcing is of utmost importance when it comes to figuring out what you should write about. The majority of your ideas need to come from regular contact with people who point you toward specific things to cover. This part of idea generation involves mindfully keeping track of the things you hear. What projects are in the works? What announcements are coming up? What are your sources excited about or worried about or looking forward to? Owning your beat lets you have a list of things that are about to happen that no one else knows about yet. You have to cultivate sources who tell you these things.</li>
<li>Another part of owning your beat is knowing who else is covering the things you care about. Occasionally, these other people will write about things that our readers care about – and when they do, it should lead to you generating an idea. Curating RSS feeds, Twitter, mailing lists – such things will lead you to aggregations and localizations.</li>
<li>Other ideas will come to you over the transom. A press release might lead to an immediate story, but it might also generate an idea. A deed filing might be something you should jump on, but there might also be a followup. Capturing these things will flesh out your reporting, letting you move from simply being reactionary to providing a deeper level of context. To be clear: The press release or deed filing is not something to put on a list to write about later; if it’s newsworthy, produce a story then. Not infrequently, though, these news items will be followed up on with additional stories.</li>
<li>Each of those first three items is sparked by someone else – by information provided by a source, by things in other publications, by items plucked from the flotsam and jetsam of information flowing around you. The true value add that you bring as a reporter is bringing those things together. This company signed a lease a few blocks away from a place someone just bought a warehouse: Is it a sign a neighborhood is turning around? Manufacturing company X said shipping through Jacksonville has gotten expensive, while fright forwarder Y said business has gotten tough: Are cargo flows about to fall? Attendance at that tech conference last month was really strong and that FSCJ technology prof says graduates are being snapped up: What does that mean for the local tech economy? Creating ideas involves pulling together disparate bits of what you know. In short – you’re the master of your beat: What stories can you tell people that they don’t know yet?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-idea-generation-process" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>The idea generation process<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-idea-generation-process"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>So those are the different wellsprings ideas can flow out of. How do you tap into that flow?</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that every idea, every reporter-generated story, begins with a “huh” moment. Obviously, what you do with the “huh” differs based on the characteristics of the story: “Huh, the mayor is about to be indicted” is different from “huh, EverBank Center is rumored to be sold” is different from “huh, it looks like a new company plans to move 45 workers to town” is different from “huh, the project seems to be taking longer than projected” is different from “huh, I bet that new incubator might help that part of town grow.”</p>
<p>Where all of those things are the same, though, is that they only come from a reporter being aware of the germ of the story and acting upon it.</p>
<p>But how do you start?</p>
<p>Here’s a process to run through to create your first list of things to write about as well as steps that can help constantly refresh it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by creating a starting point, a list of potential topics that, with some digging, can turn into things to write about.
<ul>
<li>Skim the work you’ve done over the past month and the work you or your predecessor did in the three months around this time a year ago. Do the same with your local competitors. Make a list of the topics you or they have been writing about recently and a year ago that need revisiting. (By topic, I mean something like “Orange Park hospital expansion,” “Auto volumes falling at port,” “220 Riverside opening soon” – something more specific than “hospitals” or “auto shipments” or “Downtown,” but not a specific story.) The point of going back a year (particularly for those new-ish on their beats) is to give you a sense of what type of things have been important in the past; you’re not looking to do a string of update stories, but this step should help you create a list of things that need paying attention to.</li>
<li>Go through your email, your saved press releases, your kept voice messages and your memory. List any topics that are kicking around … “App Maker X is rolling out a new product,” “Manufacturer Y just bought a $2 million machine,” “Body Central is spooking investors.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives you a list of potential topics that could be ideas. Now, shift into brainstorming mode in order to expand that list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start out by writing each of your beats. One by one, break each down into sub beats and genres. (Example: Transportation | Maritime | Shipping Lines; Transportation: Railroads | CSX; Technology | Personal Tech | Apps; Technology | Business Tech | Back Office Banking; Real Estate | CRE | Downtown; Real Estate | Residential | Homebuilders) You’ll have a handful of subbeats for each beat and a few genres for each subbeat. (Whatever list you come up with is not canonical; take it in the directions you most care about.)
<ul>
<li>For each genre, list things that are going on, things you’ve heard about, things you’re curious about, things that might need looking into. These don’t have to be big, although they can be: What’s going on with the Elks Building? How has the Black Knight merger worked? Where does the port’s master plan stand? Is the new CEO of that company worth a profile? I wonder if that banker can walk me through a how-to?</li>
<li>It should be obvious how important sourcing is when it comes to brainstorming. Without people to talk to, you won’t be able to know what they think is happening or worth looking into. Prior to brainstorming, circle back to the sources you’ve started to develop. Ask them what’s going on, what are they hearing about?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You now have a list of things to look into – basically, a list of questions that may have meaningful answers. Some of these will require a fair amount of research to for you to even know if they’re really a story; some just need one phone call to be ready to go. Some questions you’ll start digging into and discover that there’s nothing there.</p>
<p>This list should include pure hard news stories, how-tos, profiles of both people and companies, longform complicated in-depth things and quick turnaround things and things that you’re somewhat-but-not-totally-certain are stories. You may have some meeting-related things on the list (i.e., DDRB/TPO is meeting next week; should do a preview on that thing they’ll be discussing) as well as some document release-related things (i.e., venture capital investment in Florida list comes out next week; need to get an embargoed copy).</p>
<p>If you’re stuck in trying to come up with things for each area of coverage, here’s some approaches that might be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return to sourcing. If you don’t know what’s going on on your beat, it means you’re not talking to enough people or to the right people. Double down on making one-on-one connections, attending industry events, etc.</li>
<li>Have a wide range of people you’re talking to about your beat — big players, little players, customers, constituents, opponents, etc. Sourcing often focuses on talking to the people who will be in stories. Talk about your beat with people who never want to be quoted or who might just be on the periphery of your beats. What do they want to read about the topics you cover?</li>
<li>Make sure you’re reading the things your sources read: blogs and other social media, trade publications, advertisements …. The idea isn’t so much to look for localization and aggregation opportunities (although that should be done as well) but to gain an insider’s understanding of the culture and topics you’re writing about. (There’s a variety of lists of trade publications online, many of which you can get for free. If there are publications you need to pay for a subscription to, let me know and I’ll see what we can do.)</li>
<li>Read other reporters who cover the same or similar beats, particularly in different media. What type of stories are magazine writers or TV producers finding, here or elsewhere? Is the same thing happening here (trend!) or something different (we’re unique!)?</li>
<li>Having specific audiences in mind can be a good way to generate ideas that go beyond the usual. Basically, this is the inverse of the first point: Instead of approaching idea development from the source side, go at it from the (variety of) readers’ side.
<ul>
<li>What would an executive new to Jacksonville be interested in, say, or a young father returning to the workforce or a retiree looking for a new challenge? Sit down and come up with stories for specific audiences and then expand them to be of interest to a broader range of readers.</li>
<li>Create archetypes that you write for. Ideally, these will be real people who showcase some aspect of your audience: If Jane Doe were the only person reading your stuff, what would she want to read about?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idea development can be made easier if you look to develop a theme to your reporting instead of seeing every story as a one-off sort of thing.
<ul>
<li>Rather than trying to pick ideas out of the vastness of your beat, select particular subjects to focus on and mine them deeply.</li>
<li>Think of each year as a sustained body of work, in which you have the opportunity to build upon past stories. (We’ll return to this point later.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As you break your beat down into its component parts and cycle through them, focus on the ones that are the easiest to neglect. This can make sure you’re not going to the same sources and rewriting the same story.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="next-steps-1" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Next steps<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#next-steps-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>OK, so now you have a list of potential questions; once you have answers, you’ll have firm story ideas. You’re not yet at the point where you can pitch a story — but you should be at a point where you can profitably pre-report to see what the stories are.</p>
<p>At this point, you should run some of the questions by an editor to see if they’re worth pursuing (this will become less necessary over time), do some poking around and then pitch the story.</p>
<p>Shockingly, after all that work, we’re not done with idea generation. The hard work should be done, though.</p>
<p>As I hope was obvious from the list that you generated in the last step, figuring out what you need and want to write about is an ongoing process. Creating the first list provides the base for an ongoing, constantly updated list.</p>
<p>Some things that might help in keeping the list updated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open yourself up to letting people give you ideas. Too often, reporters narrow their attention down to just a few key players and dismiss things that come from other possible sources. Don’t get caught in that trap.</li>
<li>Get the word out about what you write about and what you’re interested in. (This seems obvious, but is often neglected.) Particularly if there are areas of your beat that see less attention, it’s useful to let people know that you’re looking for stories on those topics.</li>
<li>Directly ask sources, particularly lower-level ones who don’t often get such attention, what you should be covering. That’s person’s boss might be the one that ends up in the paper, but ideas can often be best found in conversation with people at a lower level.</li>
<li>Always be looking for ideas. At parties, talking to your neighbor, eavesdropping on people in line – train your mind to pick up on things that might turn into stories.</li>
<li>Once you come up with ideas, make sure you don’t lose them.
<ul>
<li>Keep an e-mail folder with messages that may lead to stories, even just tangential ones.</li>
<li>Keep a tickler file of upcoming events or things you want to circle back to at a future date. Ideas for seasonal stories always seem to come up too late. Make a note of them to do the story when the event comes around again.</li>
<li>Carry around a notebook dedicated to recording ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regularly spend time — planned, focused time — on idea generation.
<ul>
<li>Go through the things you’ve captured, the resources you’ve curated and the information provided by the sources you’ve cultivated.</li>
<li>Then, while brainstorming, first try generating ideas with a narrow focus: How many possible stories can you come up with on a particular aspect of your beat? Then, think more broadly: What big picture stories are hanging around that you’ve done bits and pieces of that you could pull together?</li>
<li>Make idea generation part of your weekly or daily schedule. Like with all creative work, don’t edit yourself while you’re brainstorming. Come up with as many ideas as you can and then cull the list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Following this process should help you break news, provide context and make sure you don’t miss stories that should be on your radar. It should also help you in making sure you always have things in the pipeline to work on and enable us to prioritize what you should be handling.</p>
