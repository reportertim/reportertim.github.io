<span class="header-section-number">18</span> Doing Ambitious Work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#doing-ambitious-work"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h1>
<p>So we started out looking at our big picture goals and then have spent a decent amount of time digging into the nuts and bolts of being a JBJ reporter.</p>
<p>As we wrap up, I wanted to return to that big picture but do so in a concrete way, laying out a path for doing the high-level, impactful work that I believe we’re here for.</p>
<p>I’ll be blunt: I want us to win awards. I want our work to be required reading. I want our work to be <em>ambitious</em>.</p>
<p>So how do we do that? Here’s a couple of thoughts that might be helpful.</p>
<div id="ambitious-work-comes-from-basic-work" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Ambitious work comes from basic work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ambitious-work-comes-from-basic-work"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The problem with talking about ambitious journalism is most reporters’ minds turns quickly to <em>project</em> journalism … and while I love a good project, we’re not set up for dedicated enterprise or investigative teams who do a few stories a month, or a year.</p>
<p>We’re set up for beat reporting — and, fortunately, I think the best in-depth reporting comes out of beat reporting.</p>
<p>For your first few months here, I need you to be a little myopic. I need you to source and write and plan and grind. I also need you to be thinking about the future — to be thinking about the journalism you’ll do once you get your feet under you and have a source base and don’t feel importer syndrome quite so much.</p>
<p>As you develop some mastery of your beat — as you have sources that are telling you meaningful things, as you’re wrapping your mind around what stories matter — you’ll start seeing the stories that benefit from more sustained attention.</p>
<p>Along the way, you’re going to do a substantial amount of basic work: briefs that need to be written, Q-and-As that connect our readers with people that matter, daily stories that are necessary but perhaps not needle-moving. All of those should be seen as a setting the base for aiming higher.</p>
</div>
<div id="think-investigatively" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Think investigatively<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#think-investigatively"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Again, we don’t have a projects team — but that’s because we should all be doing work that digs beneath the surface and uncovers things.</p>
<p>It can be very easy to forget this in the ebb and flow of daily coverage (not just here; it’s an issue with beat reporting in general).</p>
<p>Don’t fall into that mindset. Even if you’re just doing a brief or covering a groundbreaking, take a moment to step back and think if something seems off.</p>
<p>Is that number too high? Is there a reason a public agency would be do things that way? Does that explanation make sense? Are there records that should be requested?</p>
<p>Oftentimes, the answer will be no, and you’ll just move on with the story. Often enough, though, there’s a bigger story lurking behind the innocuous one — and it’s a great feeling to be able to pull it out.</p>
</div>
<div id="make-a-list" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Make a list<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#make-a-list"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>What stories are you hearing about that you want to break?</p>
<p>Again, sourcing is paramount here … but after a few months on the job, you should have a list of stories that you can’t quite nail down yet.</p>
<p>You’ve heard a building is being sold or a retailer is coming to town or a project is running into trouble – but the reporting isn’t yet solid enough to write that story.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of those things</em> — and make sure you’re staying on top of them.</p>
<p>Every time you talk to someone who might be able to incrementally advance the reporting, or who might know who else to talk to, toss a question or two at them.</p>
<p>Put a reminder on your calendar to place a weekly call to the PR person; “hey, any movement?”</p>
<p>File records requests that may lead to something in the future.</p>
<p>Be purposeful about the pursuit; there’s nothing more frustrating than being aware of news that someone else then breaks because you backburnered it.</p>
</div>
<div id="drive-the-conversation" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Drive the conversation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#drive-the-conversation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>When I say “set the base for something higher,” embedded in that concept is the idea that you should know what “higher” is.</p>
<p>One way of thinking about it is that you want your stories to drive the important conversations happening on your beat. What are the things that our readers most care about? What information are they most in need of?</p>
<p>Figuring this out will be part of the ongoing conversations you have with the editors, and it’s not something that I expect you to do right off the bat. But I do expect you to be thinking this way from the get-go.</p>
<p>As you read back through our coverage, as you talk to sources and you begin reporting, always have the idea in the back of your mind that you’re trying to identify the broad stories where you can have the most impact.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-a-body-of-work" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Create a body of work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-a-body-of-work"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I referenced this in the section on idea generation, and it’s key approach to both coming up with stories and having those stories be high impact.</p>
<p>Once you’ve been here a few months, we’ll have a conversation about the areas of your beat that are the most important and the most interesting to you. The goal is to pick a somewhat broad topic and mine it for all that it’s worth.</p>
<p>The way to think through this: If your work on this topic was compiled at the end of the year, you’d have a book. What would be in that book? And, can you purposefully set out to make that book as good as possible?</p>
<p>It’s easy to let the pressure of news direct your coverage — and most of the time, it should. But by picking a topic that you will own, that you will fully explore, you’ll be able to build something substantial.</p>
<p>This can be challenging: If you’re saying that there is a topic on your beat that you want to cover fully, that means doing a few stories every month on that topic. Sometimes you’ll have to dig deep to find a new angle or come up with a new person to talk to … but the payoff is that you’re required to go beyond the surface and think creatively about how to advance the story.</p>
<p>Again, this doesn’t come into play your first few months here; you need to know what is important and what you’re most interested in. For now, though, have this concept in mind as something that you’re thinking about for when we have that conversation.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-the-editors-1" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Use the editors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#use-the-editors-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>One of the points of the meetings we have is to give us all a moment to step away from the Sturm und Drang of daily coverage and <em>think</em> for a moment.</p>
<p>In your one-on-ones, come with ideas for short-term enterprise work and follow-up stories — both following up your own work and just building on things that are happening.</p>
</div>
<div id="raise-your-gaze" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Raise your gaze<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#raise-your-gaze"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Journalism can be a grind. It’s a Sisyphean job where there’s always another deadline, and between the juggling of sourcing, reporting, writing, planning and just plain feeding the beast, it’s easy to get lost in the weeds.</p>
<p>To counter that, I’d urge you to spend some time each week, maybe each day, casting your gaze a little higher, making sure that you’re chasing after big, impactful stories.</p>
<p>Some of the other things we’ve talked about will help with this: If you’re regularly sourcing, you’re going to be plugged in with people who are doing exciting things. If you’re regularly setting aside time to think about data and records and to refresh your seed list, you’re creating space for deeper and more insightful reporting to blossom.</p>
<p>Particularly in your first few months, your focus is on mastering the basics. As you do, purposefully think about how everything you’re doing can lead to the impactful work you want to do.</p>
