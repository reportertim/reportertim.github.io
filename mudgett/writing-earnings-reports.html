</h1>
<p>Earnings reports are a staple of business journalism and will be an important part of the work you do here — but not necessarily for the reason you think.</p>
<p>These stories tend not to get a huge amount of traction with readers; the main reason for doing them is because it gives you an opportunity to delve into a company’s plumbing: By reading their SEC filings and understanding how the company’s finances work, you should start seeing other storylines that you should pursue.</p>
<p>In some ways, you can think of this as a form of sourcing, just with documents instead of people. The goal of the earnings reports that you’ll do once a quarter is to find out what makes a company tick and connect with company leaders.</p>
<p>The story is just a side effect, and the focus should be on doing it quickly, efficiently and accurately.</p>
<p>Here’s how to approach them:</p>
<div id="reporting" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Reporting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reporting"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>You should a general understanding of what’s going on with the public companies assigned to you. This means following them on social media, signing up for any releases they send out and having Google alerts for them.</p>
<p>The public companies you cover are listed in your beat description. You can find more information about that <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qHBcKC3Mf6htw1jjNoGjYAAig3ClWeULnrzbzqjRinQ/edit#gid=0">at this link</a>, and you can get a sense of how local companies are doing by looking at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DHLnqa5YTy08v2cuSJFoY9iJV5HzN5zjMvVONiG-zas/edit#gid=0">Jacksonville portfolio page</a>.</p>
<p>A key to doing earnings reports well: <em>Read examples of them</em>. These are formulaic stories that if you haven’t spent a lot of time doing finance reporting you’re probably not familiar with. Go back and look at the ones we’ve done on the companies you cover; see what the WSJ and NYT and AP have done. It’s incumbent upon you to familiarize yourself with the genre before jumping in.</p>
<p>When we get into earnings season, you should try to connect with any analysts who cover the companies you care about. I say “try,” because this has gotten more challenging in the past several years. If you can get analysts to send you their research notes, that will go far in keeping you informed on how the market is viewing the company; if you can get an analyst on the phone, you’ll be able to elevate your earnings coverage.</p>
<p>You should also spend some time looking at the past three earnings reports — both the documents themselves and the stories that resulted.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the main thing you need to do before the earnings come out is make sure you know the details of how the release will happen — what day, if it is before the market opens or after it closes, will the company be doing a call with analysts and when.</p>
<p>When the earnings come out, you want to read the company’s press release as well as the actual filing (which should be included in the release).</p>
<p>For our largest companies (CSX, LSTR, FIS, REG, DFH), you should plan on always listening in on the following earnings call. For the others, the decision will be based on how the company did and the likelihood that news will be generated; even if you don’t listen it, it can be worthwhile to find a transcript of the call and give it a quick read. Talk to an editor as the earning date approaches to make sure we’re on the same page.</p>
</div>
<div id="writing" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Writing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#writing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The focus of your earnings coverage should be on what the quarterly/annual results mean for the company — and the lede should make that clear. “In a sign that the sector is softening, CSX Corp.’s revenue fell …” or “As Regency Centers increases its rents, the Jacksonville-based real estate investment trust saw net income soar” or something else that makes clear what the numbers signify.</p>
<p>In the second or third graf, you should lay out how the company did. The first key figure here is net income and income per share, with revenue as a secondary key figure. These numbers should generally <em>not</em> be in the lede.</p>
<p>The important thing is how these figures compare to the figures <em>in the same quarter a year ago</em>. Most of the time, you’re not going to compare the second quarter to the first quarter but rather to the second quarter of the previous year.</p>
<p>By and large, you want to use the GAAP figures. For real estate investment trusts, look at funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations. You generally should look with suspicion on any bespoke figures (adjusted EBIDTA, say), although in some cases you should include them <em>in addition</em> to the GAAP figures.</p>
<p>Don’t be misled by adjustments like one-time charges or things like that. Again, it might make sense to mention it in the story, but be aware that the company often is making those adjustments as a way to burnish their results.</p>
<p>Be careful to understand what you’re writing. Profits can decrease, but that is not a loss; losses can shrink, but that doesn’t make them profits.</p>
<p>Don’t go overboard with the numbers. In general, we care more about percentage changes than the raw figures.</p>
<p>Pulling out figures other than the main ones can be useful. If the company breaks out how different components or areas of its business is doing, look through that section to see if that will elucidate the overall narrative.</p>
<p>While the SEC filings is, by definition, looking back, the story should try as much as possible to look ahead: While it’s important to know how a company did in the latest quarter, what we really care about is what that quarter says about the path the company is on. This will be discussed during the call with analysts and is often in the company’s presentation of its results, although not necessarily in the file that is sent to the SEC.</p>
<p>Anything the company says about forecasts, future intentions or plans or anything along those lines should be high up in the story.</p>
<p>Remember that these are <em>stories</em>, not infodumps. Anything that you can do to help readers understand the narrative is good. That can include bringing in information from other stories about decisions the company is making or plans it has announced.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure you’re reading the earnings release and SEC filing carefully. Bad news will often be tucked in out-of-the-way places, including in footnotes. Just because you’re approaching this as an earnings story does not mean that’s all that will result.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#final-thoughts-4"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Earnings coverage can be scary at first: You’re entering a world you probably haven’t spent a lot of time in before, there’s gobs of numbers and figuring out what is important can be tough.</p>
<p>If you spend some time reading earnings stories — ours, the ones done by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg — and looking over what the documents look like <em>before</em> you write your first one, a lot of that angst should melt away.</p>
<p>If you want to delve more into the world of SEC filings, I have multiple handouts on the various forms, what you’re looking for in them, etc. (On that note: You should pay attention whenever a company you’re following files an 8-K; they won’t always be newsworthy, but you should check.)</p>
<p>Going through the process of delving into a public company’s finances should help you gain a deeper understanding into the financial underpinnings of all businesses, which can pay off across your beat.</p>
