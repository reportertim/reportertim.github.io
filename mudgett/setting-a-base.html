<p>The next few weeks — and the rest of this document — are designed to get you up to speed as a new JBJ reporter</p>
<p>Over the coming three months, your focus will be on building up a credible network of sources, digging out stories and learning how we expect you to juggle daily coverage, evergreen pieces and enterprise reporting.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, though, I wanted to lay out your to-do list for the first week or so, with everything here designed to help set the base for what is to come.</p>
<div id="basebox" class="greybox" title="Onboarding Path">
<p>We hired you because we think you can report and write at the level we’re looking for — and that typically means that you want to jump into producing journalism. That’s good … but I’ve found that we get the best results when a new reporter has a little bit of time to get acclimated to what’s going on.</p>
</div>
<div id="morgue-dive" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Morgue Dive<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#morgue-dive"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>While I assume you want to start writing as soon as possible, my expectation is that you’re starting the job knowing little about Jacksonville or what’s going on here. So, step one is to get you up to speed.</p>
<p>First, start by reading.</p>
<p>Starting with the JBJ, read through what was being covered in August 2023, October 2023 and November 2023, and what was being written about in May 2024, July 2024 and July 2024.</p>
<p>Why these dates? The goal is to see what was being covered a year ago, with the idea that stories occur in cycles: If there was something happening around this time last year, there’s a good chance that it could be something you should be looking at now.</p>
<p>The more recent dates give you a sense of stories in motion: As you look at those, you should be thinking of things that might need to be updated or advanced.</p>
<p>For the JBJ stuff, your focus should be on your beats. Do this in the CMS (making sure to open the links, not the actual stories) and use the Channel filter to narrow things down to the stories you care about</p>
<p>Once you’re done with our archives, take a look at the Florida Times-Union, WJCT News and the Jacksonville Daily Record. While our coverage aims are not identical to those publications, there’s enough overlap (and stories that they’ve covered that we might not have gotten to) that you’ll find ideas, avenues of exploration, etc.</p>
<p>Then, take the Lists from the Book of Lists that pertain to your beats and start googling. See what has been written about these companies by outlets either local or national; check out their sites and LinkedIn pages and see what the company and people associated with the company are posting.</p>
<p>Along the way, you’ll find other publications that touch on topics we care about (the Jaxon does interesting stuff touching on real estate, Trains Magazine can be a good place to see what’s going on with railroads, Edible Northeast Florida provides a specific window into the local restaurant scene, etc.)</p>
<p>As you’re doing all of this, make notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the people who pop up who you should connect with?</li>
<li>Who should you be following on social media? (LinkedIn across all beats, Instagram on the retail beat, but wherever you find sources works.)</li>
<li>What governmental agencies might have records that would be worth requesting?</li>
<li>Are there trade publications you should look at regularly / we should look at getting a subscription to?</li>
<li>What stories were big a year ago that might have fallen off the radar and should be revisited?</li>
<li>What happened a few months ago that might deserve a follow-up?</li>
<li>What stories did we miss during the interregnum before you started that we should try to get to now?</li>
<li>What do readers in general seem interested in?</li>
</ul>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div id="morguebox" class="greybox" title="Onboarding Path">
<p>You’ll spend several days doing the morgue dive, and you should treat it as an important part of the onboarding process. At the end of it, you should have a robust document with a number of people you want to connect with and a list of things that you think might be worth jumping into with your initial stories.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="lay-of-the-land" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Lay of the Land<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lay-of-the-land"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Jacksonville is the largest city by land mass in the continental U.S., mainly due to the 1968 consolidation that merged the city with (and get used to hearing this) DUUUUVAL County.</p>
<p>The metro area stretches from the border with Georgia to the north to Flagler Beach to the south. The western boundary is a semicircle stretching through Macclenny, Keystone Heights and Palatka.</p>
<p>There’s no way we could cover all of that or that you could find your way around that entire stretch — but I think it’s helpful to have some sense of the terrain.</p>
<p>(For the record: The areas in the MSA that we care most about are Duval, St. Johns, Nassau and Clay counties, in that order. If we find news in Flagler, Putnam and Baker, we should cover them, but <em>do not</em> put a lot of effort, particularly initially, in anything beyond the top four counties.)</p>
<p>Soon after you start, I’ll take you on a tour of downtown, giving you a quick sketch of the urban core. The future of downtown and efforts to revitalize it are one of the key stories we care about, and it cuts across beats, so I want to make sure you have some sense of where things are.</p>
<p>On your own, you should spend an afternoon driving around Duval County, getting a sense of how the various pieces fit together. To help with that, here’s a map that takes you to a bunch of different places: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/cS92BDfvce2xYqYa6" class="uri">https://maps.app.goo.gl/cS92BDfvce2xYqYa6</a> (The exact spots don’t matter, mostly; they’re just to get you in the general locale.)</p>
<p>We’ll talk through that map so you understand why those places are there, but I’ll leave it up to you to plot a route that works depending on where you’re living, etc.</p>
<p>As you do the driving around (and make sure you keep track of mileage and expense it), take notes: What things are you seeing that seem intriguing or don’t make sense or feel like they could point to a story? I <em>do not</em> expect a list of valid story ideas out of this little jaunt, but I do expect you to create a list of starting point of things that might be interesting.</p>
</div>
<div id="tap-in-to-acbj" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Tap in to ACBJ<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tap-in-to-acbj"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>One of the benefits of working for a company with 40-plus publications filled with people doing things similar to what you do is that you can tap into a wealth of in-house expertise.</p>
<p>As you are getting your feet under you, spend some time looking around ACBJ and see what your peers are doing. In many cases, the editors might have suggestions for particular reporters to follow, but it can also be valuable to simply browse some other markets and see what they’re up to.</p>
<p>In this vein, look at the list of slack channel based on various beats. Some of these are more active than others, and the most robust ones can help direct you to stories you might not have thought of, resources you might not be aware of and other reporters who might be able to help you if you run into issues.</p>
<p>Through your bizjournals.com account, you can sign up for emails from any of the markets; starting out, the other Florida markets would probably be a good place to start when it comes to connecting with the company overall. (You should, of course, make sure to sign up for <em>our</em> emails …)</p>
</div>
<div id="next-steps" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Next Steps<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#next-steps"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>By the end of your first week, you should have a pretty robust list of people, organizations, topics and — hopefully — some story ideas that will provide the base for the weeks to come.</p>
<p>A few days after you start, we’ll start talking about the list you made and (as I go into great detail in the next section) you’ll start focusing your attention on sourcing.</p>
