<p>So we’ve gone through many key steps in getting your feet under you at the JBJ, from getting to know your beat to building up a source network to understanding what we’re looking for in stories.</p>
<p>In this section, I want to get very practical and talk about day-to-day reporting and writing, going over meetings, productivity and process things.</p>
<div id="planningbox" class="greybox" title="Onboarding Path">
<p>Two key points: 1. We expect a fairly high level of production at the JBJ, but it’s a managable workload is you approach it properly. Read this section carefully so you know what to expect. 2. Most reporters aren’t great at planning. Sharpening that skill will help immensely.</p>
</div>
<div id="production" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Production<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#production"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, you’re expected to have something on the order of eight to 10 posts a week. “Posts” is chosen specifically in that sentence: Not everything you file is created equally; doing eight briefs a week doesn’t fulfill the mandate, but nor should you be running yourself ragged to turn around a half-dozen in-depth stories each week.</p>
<p>In general, you should have three full stories — planned-out, conversation-driving stories — each week.</p>
<p>The goal of these stories is to break news — to tell readers something significant that will be done or is being done that has not been reported by anyone before. This will not always be possible, particularly in your first six months — but that is the goal.</p>
<p>These stories can also fulfill our goal of providing context and strategic knowledge to our readers — helping them understand trends that are shaping the Jacksonville economy, providing insight into how a person or company did something, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The thought that should be forefront in your mind as you search for stories is why does this matter. You need to have a goal in mind with every story you tell.</p>
<p>These news-breaking, somewhat-in-depth stories will be 450 to 550 words; rarely would you ever go over 650 words, and only after a conversation with an editor. The expectation is that writing these stories should take about two hours. You should endeavor to get decent art with these.</p>
<p>You should have one story each week introducing our readers to someone they need to know. These can be profiles or Q-and-A’s and should run 450 to 700 words. Profiles should take up to two hours to write; Q-and-A’s should take an hour. (We’ll talk more about Q-and-As in a bit). For each of these, you need a headshot of the subject, or an environmental sort of shot.</p>
<p>You should have two or three meeting stories/earnings briefs/reports/previews and other such stories that keep you engaged with your beat and give our readers context for the news we break. These should take up to an hour and a half to write.</p>
<p>You should have two to five quick-turn briefs. The number, cadence and source of these will change per beat: The reporter who covers real estate will have permit briefs, the retail reporter should be mining social media posts for quick turn stories and the industrial reporter should be monitoring state contract announcements. These are easy stories that keep our readers engaged, point to opportunities and show that we’re the publication to turn to for news. These should take half an hour or so to write.</p>
<p>These briefs should be things where you have value to add: You’re immersed in the story so you can do it quicker or with more nuance or detail, you’re using it to connect with a source, you got the announcement before it went wide, something like that. If it is something more generic that anyone can cover, pass it on to an editor: You might end up doing it depending on what other people are working on, but reporters should be focused on higher-value work and the editors can do more commodity news if a story is required at all.</p>
<p>One note on briefs: Don’t hold them. If they’re assigned, the assumption is that they’ll be turned in roughly immediately. There’s no point, generally speaking, in scheduling a brief for later. If you don’t have time to do them ASAP, let an editor know, and they can either help you prioritize or figure out a different path to take.</p>
<p>You should plan on having one cover story every four to five weeks. The cover story process should follow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NA5khaUA2TEatah0DSByH2hUVMbGpzMzeFEqfeBC0-Q/edit#gid=1493329012">timeline laid out here</a>. In general, you should have a firm pitch nailed down five weeks or more before the story is due.</p>
<p>Reporting out the CP should take 8 to 15 hours spread out over the course of the month. You will be given a block of uninterrupted time to write the CP, which should take around four to six hours.</p>
<p>The expectations is that you will always be working on a planned-out centerpiece and will also be looking for daily stories that could be elevated to be a cover story.</p>
</div>
<div id="planning" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Planning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#planning"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Our rhythm should always be governed by the news; even as business reporters, we’re going to have days that stretch beyond business hours. Days like that should happen because the news requires it, though, not through lack of planing.</p>
<p>Even though we should be able to jump on a big story and win the coverage wars doesn’t mean that there’s any value in treating every day like we’re just waiting for things to unfold. To that end, we have a couple of meetings and a budgeting tool that you should use to help stay on track.</p>
<p>First, the meetings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every morning, we meet at 9:30 a.m. either in person or on Teams. You’ll get an invite to this meeting soon after starting. The idea is that you will, by that meeting, have a firm grasp on what your day will look like: What interviews you have, what stories are coming in, what work you’re doing on future stories.</li>
<li>Tuesday afternoons, we have a look-ahead meeting. The first part of this gathering is focused on centerpiece stories; you should come prepared with an update on whatever CPs you have in the works. The second part of that meeting is more open-ended, giving us an opportunity to step back from the hustle and bustle to see if there is anything on the horizon we should be prepared for. This is a good time to talk about potential story ideas, things you’re hearing and events coming up that might be worth covering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Day-to-day coverage is governed by the budget <a href="https://acbj-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tgibbons_bizjournals_com/Lists/JBJ%20Planning%203">that you can access here</a>. You add things to the budget by clicking the “add new items” button in the top left corner.</p>
<p>In general, you should have about five to seven things on the budget for the coming two weeks — two or three of your planned stories, the profile/q-and-a, meetings and reports, earnings, etc.</p>
<p>Quick-turn briefs should be discussed in the morning meeting or as they come up and then be added to the budget.</p>
<p>Items on the budget over the next two days (i.e., when I look at the budget Tuesday night, the things slated for Wednesday and Thursday) should be firm; unless something truly unexpected happens, they should be turned in on the day and at the time indicated.</p>
<p>Out days are softer; things more than a week out are basically notional — meaning there’s nothing wrong with putting a story on the budget two weeks out even if you’re not certain that it will come in then. By the time “two weeks out” becomes “two days out,” though, it’s on you to make sure that what is on the budget is accurate.</p>
<p>You can move stuff on the out days, but if you’re shifting things that are scheduled for the next few days, let an editor know, since that starts affecting production scheduling.</p>
<p><em>It is your responsibility to budget stories, and to make sure the budget is accurate</em>. If something has been sitting on the budget for a few days, it shouldn’t change at the last moment.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-budget-tool" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>The budget tool<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-budget-tool"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We’ll go over budgeting during one of our initial conversations, but I’ll put some of the details here as well.</p>
<p>The most important fields that you will fill out <a href="https://acbj-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tgibbons_bizjournals_com/Lists/JBJ%20Planning%203?viewid=a1fb1466-c5cc-4f2e-b860-514cf8dbd979&amp;env=WebViewList">when you budget a story</a> is the headline and gist of the story. <em>These can change</em> as you go through the reporting and writing process, but it is vital that you know where you’re going with a story before you embark on it.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/headline-gist-new.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p></p>
<p>The headline should be something that you think will grab readers’ attention, and the gist should, basically, be what you think the nutgraf will be. Accordingly, this <em>won’t</em> be something like “Q-and-A with Sally Smith” or “DIA meeting,” but rather what you plan on getting out of those events.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/file-date-time-new.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p></p>
<p>The filing data and time are used to help us figure out what will be running when. As noted above, these are aspirational for out days and should be solid over the next day or two. If you mark a story as tentative (if, for example, you need one more interview and you think the subject might flake), let an editor know when it becomes solid.</p>
<p>The time field is so we don’t plan a story for Afternoon Edition when it’s coming in at, say, 3 p.m. and it’s not a story we have to rush on. <em>These are the latest times a story should be filed</em>, and represents a commitment that you’ll get it in by that time. If you’re not going to be able to hit the filing deadline, talk to an editor in advance. Also, don’t push stuff later if there’s no reason to: If a story can be sent in at 10 a.m., do that, don’t wait until later in the day, even if that’s the deadline.</p>
<p>As you’re planning, think through what your day looks like. If you’re doing a Q-and-A at 2 p.m. and there’s not vital news in it, don’t budget it to run in afternoon edition. You can still write it and file it, but there’s no value in treating non-breaking-news like an emergency; there’s a lot of things we want you to turn around quickly, but acting like everything is a quick-turn story is a path to burnout.</p>
<p>One final note on the budget tool: It’s designed to help you with your planning as well as govern the production schedule. If you mark a story as “Planning,” it will not show up in the other views; no editor will be expecting it. This allows you to schedule things for the future even when they’re tentative, giving you a grasp on what you have in the works.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/planning-new.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p></p>
<p>When we go over the tool during our initial conversations, we’ll talk about the other views available to you that can help you with planning out your coverage and organizing your days.</p>
<div id="planningboxs" class="greybox" title="Onboarding Path">
<p>We’ll go over the budget during onboarding, which should help make all of this clear.</p>
</div>
<p>Last thing on planning: We don’t have an end of the day meeting, but please check in with me before you clock out for the day. This is a mixture of good practice and my own pet peeve, to be clear — but it drives me nuts when reporters just vanish into the ether. A quick slack or popping your head into my office just to let me know where things stand, what the next day looks like, see if there’s any unresolved issues is all you need to do.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-overwhelmed" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Getting overwhelmed<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#getting-overwhelmed"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>One final note that fits into this section: We tend to keep a lot of balls in the air, and I’ll never be shy about asking if you have the capacity to add something else to your plate. When I ask that, I’m <em>asking</em> that. Particularly with a hybrid work environment, it’s easy for me to not have a truly firm grasp on everything you have going on.</p>
<p>If I need you to shift your attention to something, and you don’t have the bandwidth to do so, <em>let me know</em>: Putting something on your plate will sometimes mean I have to take something off. I’m happy to make that decision, but you’ll have to let me know where things stand so I can effectively prioritize.</p>
<p>Along those lines: I’d implore you not to write on deadline when you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Your focus should be on being the first with news, and often this will require fast writing and last-minute editing. <em>But there’s no reason to do that when a story doesn’t require it.</em> If you’re doing a Q-and-A interview Monday morning, plan to file it Monday afternoon — maybe even Tuesday morning. If you have a story with multiple interviews, write as you’re going along.</p>
<p>If you can, come into work with the reporting done on a piece and start your day by getting a post filed early, it makes everything run more smoothly while cutting down on your stress level.</p>
