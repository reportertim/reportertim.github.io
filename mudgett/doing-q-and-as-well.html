</h1>
<p>Q-and-As should be a regular part of your reporting repertoire. They’re an easy way to get face time with an executive, they should include information our readers need and — above all — they should be <em>easy</em>.</p>
<p>Over my years of editing, though, I’ve seen many reporters struggle with Q-and-As, either turning in wordy mush that no one wants to wade through, taking far too long to produce them or — all too often — both.</p>
<p>This section aims at helping you avoid both of those pitfalls. We’ll walk through how to prepare for a Q-and-A both mentally and practically, how to conduct the interview and how to quickly turn what results into a post.</p>
<div id="purpose" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Purpose<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#purpose"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Q-and-As are designed to introduce our readers to people they should know. This means you have to be strategic about who you talk to; you’re looking for CEOs, newsmakers, people whose voices are important in the conversation. Don’t do a Q-and-A just because it’s easy.</p>
<p>Q-and-As are a good way to build on the news. You might do a post telling readers a thing they need to know about and then following up with a Q-and-A with the person behind the news. [Pro tip: You can knock out the reporting for both in one interview.]</p>
<p>There’s a sourcing benefit as well: Calling up a random CEO can be hard; asking to speak with a CEO for 20 minutes for a Q-and-A gives you an entry point.</p>
<p>You can also tag these on to the end of a sourcing meeting or even an interview for a centerpiece, killing multiple birds with one stone.</p>
</div>
<div id="preparation" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Preparation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preparation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Quick doesn’t mean easy, though. Without preparation, these can become meandering blocks of text that don’t benefit the reader.</p>
<p>Some key things to keep in mind:</p>
<p>You need to go into the Q-and-A having a clear goal as to what you want to get out of it. What would you like the headline to be? You should not be thinking “Q-and-A with Bob Smith” but rather “CEO explains why company XYZ did ABC” or “How this CEO made this decision” or “How this executive is planning to deal with this challenge.”</p>
<p>And then you have to focus your questions toward that goal.</p>
<p>In some ways, doing a question-and-answer interview isn’t really an interview. Most of the time, interviews should be focused conversations; like any good conversation, they can be wide ranging and have tangents, and they are all about digging into things.</p>
<p>Q-and-As are hyper-focused, have flow instead of tangents and hit predetermined marks instead of going off in random directions.</p>
<p>You’re basically writing the story in real time.</p>
<p>That means you have to go into the interview very prepared. You will almost always ask no more than seven questions, of which five will end up in the interview. You need to know what most or all of these questions are ahead of time and in what order you will ask them.</p>
<p>Do followups, of course, but don’t rely on that</p>
<p>As you arrange your questions, you can either take the subject point by point (What are you trying to accomplish, why is that important, what does success look like, what comes next) or topic by topic (What is the employment situation like? How will inflation affect supply prices? Which competitor are you most afraid of?)</p>
</div>
<div id="writing-the-q-and-a" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Writing the Q-and-A<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#writing-the-q-and-a"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Obviously you’re recording the conversation; trying to take notes for a verbatim-focused story is pointless.</p>
<p>After the interview, you should have the robots transcribe it. (Otter, Trint, Teams, etc.)</p>
<p><em>You should not file this raw transcription.</em></p>
<p>Every Q-and-A we do has the note that it has been edited for clarity and length. That editing is the second part of the journalistic work you’re doing on this type of story.</p>
<p>The Q-and-A should be edited to make sure the computer didn’t screw up something; go back and listen to anything that seems like it might be a mistranscription.</p>
<p>They should also be edited to be good journalism. Your questions are cut down to the bone of what you asked (Don’t change context. If you asked, “In the retail field, what does employment look like,” that can’t be changed to just “what does employment look like”. But if you have a whole setup about why you’re asking about retail, get rid of it.)</p>
<p>Words are not changed, but cuts are made. Ums and ahs, tangents, the bit where the person didn’t answer the question but you pushed them and then they did — get rid of all of that.</p>
<p>Then look the piece over again. Are there answers that don’t really say anything? Those should be cut. Are there meandering bits that don’t add anything. Cut. Is there anything that doesn’t make sense without adding a bunch of context? Cut.</p>
<p>We are giving our readers an insight into a newsmaker’s mind, not making them read a transcription. Any part of the conversation that does not advance the post toward this goal should be jettisoned.</p>
<p>(That said: If you’re doing a lot of cuts, it might be time to reconsider if a Q-and-A is the best way to approach this story. Some people are not good subjects for this type of story; if that’s the case, discuss with an editor what you do with what you have.)</p>
<p>You should then write an intro setting up the conversation. Explain to the reader why you spoke to this person at this time and why their thoughts are valuable.</p>
<p>The goal is to have a streamlined story, probably on the order of 600 to 700 words, that has a point and doesn’t make the reader search for it.</p>
