<p>When it comes to writing, getting things right is <em>the</em> essential part of your job.</p>
<p>Mistakes kill your credibility as a reporter, damage our reputation as a publication and make the job of reporting harder.</p>
<p>You know all of that; we wouldn’t have hired you if we thought you had an issue with accuracy. That said, mistakes can happen, so I want to talk a bit about how to deal with them when they do and explore some ways that we make sure they don’t.</p>
<div id="when-mistakes-happen" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>When mistakes happen<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#when-mistakes-happen"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Like everything else in this document, we’ll discuss all of this during the onboarding process, but I want to put this in writing to make sure we’re on the same page: If there is anything that has to be changed in a story, <em>you must talk to an editor</em>.</p>
<p>A benign typo, a source who wants you to change “around 150 seats in the restaurant” to “the restaurant will have 147 seats”, adding in the architect of a project that you didn’t have when the story first ran — any change at all requires you talking to an editor. For the minor stuff, you’ll probably be told to make the change and republish, but do not do so on your own.</p>
<p>That conversation should not be an antagonistic one; we may need to have a deeper conversation about accuracy, but at this point, the goal is just to make sure the story is correct and up to date.</p>
<p>You must act quickly in dealing with requests for changes. This means responding to the source to tell them you’re dealing with it and then calling an editor — Tim first, and then James and then Stuart — not just sending an email and waiting for them to see it.</p>
<p>For anything more serious, the same process applies, but the urgency is ramped up. If anyone calls about a substantial correction, here’s how you should handle it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be polite. This is not the time to argue with the source. Listen to them and make sure you understand the issue they’re calling about, and then tell them an editor will get back to them shortly.</li>
<li>Do not argue. I know I just said that, but I want to repeat it. Dealing with an angry source is not in your job description. Pass it on up the chain.</li>
<li>Don’t apologize. While you shouldn’t argue with the source, it’s also important to not swing the other way: Don’t say things like “oh, crap, I did get that wrong” or “you’re right, that is a mistake.” Your job at this point is not to mollify the person; it’s to ascertain the situation and get an editor to deal with it as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Get in touch with an editor. Call, slack, email, text — if someone says we have something substantially wrong, you need to escalate immediately and get an editor involved. (If no one is responding, you can move up to the publisher and the editorial team in corporate; we’ll talk about how to do that when we discuss this, but that hasn’t yet had to happen.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Having mistakes not happen<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#having-mistakes-not-happen"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I started out talking about how to deal with requests for changes because following those steps is vitally important … but even better is never having to have those conversations.</p>
<p>Getting to that point means making a final fact check a part of your reporting process — but it’s not enough to just read over a story and say, “well, I think it looks good.” Here’s the process you should follow with every story you file; for most daily pieces, it’ll take about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Importantly, this process is designed to have you spend a few minutes looking at the totality of the story: While it makes sure the basics are correct, it’s also an opportunity to look at bigger things, giving a final check to the facts, the overall point of the story, the way it is structured and how it is written.</p>
<p>Here’s the steps you should take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are names and titles correct? Don’t rely on your notes; Google names, look at LinkedIn for titles. When you’re sure, put “CQ” next to them in notes mode.</li>
<li>Are numbers correct? Again, it’s good to have a source other than your notes if possible. CQ these as well.</li>
<li>Do you have any doubts about the overall thrust of the story or any specific details? Would you be comfortable saying everything in the story to the sources you talked to?</li>
<li>Have you constructed a headline and teases that are accurate and will grab readers?</li>
<li>Have you filled out all the fields in the CMS, including attaching a photo?</li>
<li>Have you linked back to previous coverage?</li>
<li>Does the lede do its job of hooking the reader? Can you make it shorter or grabbier?</li>
<li>Is the gist of the story clearly stated in the lede and/or nut graf? Does it carry through the story? Can you make it better or clearer?</li>
<li>Is anything missing from the story? Are there questions you still have? (If so, note those in the story and talk to an editor.)</li>
<li>Does the story flow the way it should - inverted pyramid, chronological, chunked, etc. … will readers be able to follow the narrative logic?</li>
<li>Is there nuance you should add? Better descriptions, better quotes, additional context …</li>
<li>Do you have things in the story that don’t matter — extraneous things you can get rid of? If so, cut them.</li>
<li>Did you use active verbs? Can you punch them up?</li>
<li>Is there something that happens next, and, if so, did you let readers know about that?</li>
</ul>
<p>That list is based on on one I had hanging over my computer for most of my reporting career, starting after I made some mistakes and wanted to make sure it didn’t happen again. It carried me through daily reporting, investigative work, long-form enterprise pieces and more.</p>
<p>If you make a checklist like that part of your daily practice, it will help you avoid corrections and should also elevate your writing in general.</p>
